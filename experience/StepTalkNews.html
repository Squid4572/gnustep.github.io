    <h1>News</h1>


<h2 class=news>2003 Nov 24 - Release of Version 0.8.1  </h2>

    <p>Added STConversation object. Basically, it's a conversation with 
    objects in an environment using a scripting language. The reason
    for creating this clas was to open a path for easier remote scripting
    where you can 'talk in a conversation' with a remote DO server or
    application. However, this remote part is just going to be implemented.
    Added ReadlineTranscript. Renamed, added and deprecated some STEnvironment
    methods. Methods were not removed, NSLog warnings were added.
    </p>

    <p>
    Also a link to the <a href="http://www.moltalk.org">MolTalk</a>, project that
    uses StepTalk, was added at the <a href="links.html">links page.</a>
    </p>

<h2 class=news>2003 Nov 17 - StepTalk moving.  </h2>

    <p>StepTalk has been moved. </p>

    
<h2 class=news>2003 Aug 13 - Release of Version 0.8.0  </h2>

    <p>Noteworthy changes from lates release are: StepTalk has been
    finally changed to a framework. Script objects were introduced. For more
    information about Script Objects see 
    <a href="http://wiki.gnustep.org/index.php/Script%20Objects">this page</a>.
    
    <p>StepTalk module was removed, because it was no longer required.
    Added framework loading support in environment description files (.stenv).
    Some bugs were fixed and code was cleaned a bit.
    
    <p><strong>Important note:</strong> You HAVE to remove your previous
    installation of StepTalk to be able to install new one. 
    (especially Local/Library/Headers/StepTalk). This is required because of
    the change from library to a framework.

<h2 class=news>2003 Jun 17 - Prerelease of Version 0.7.2  </h2>

    <p>Created a workaround for gnustep-base Distributed Objects bug. Now
    communication with distant objects should work correctly and should not 
    cause segfaults or other odd behaviour.
    Some generated documentation added. Implemented Framework support. 
    How to make Frameworks scriptable is <a href="http://wiki.gnustep.org/index.php/Advertising%20Scripting%20Capabilities">here</a>,
    and how to use frameworks from your script is 
    <a href="http://wiki.gnustep.org/index.php/Using%20Scripting%20Capabilities%20of%20Bundles">here</a>.
    Some Smalltalk parser bugs were fixed.</p>

<h2 class=news>2003 Apr 21 - Application Scripting and Version 0.7.1  </h2>

    <p>Prepared StepTalk for <a href="apptalk.html">application scripting 
    support</a>. Added application scripting support bundle. Added
    documentation for application scripting. Many source cleanups by David
    Ayers. Some bugfixes in Smalltalk source reader.</p>
    
    <p>Added <a href="Documentation/StepTalk.html">
    Library Reference</a> documentation.


<h2 class=news>2003 Feb 3 - Version 0.7.0 </h2>

    <p>Changes since the prerelease: Code cleaned for many compiler
    warnings. In Smalltalk: reading of integers and assignments is more
    intelligent.


<h2 class=news>2003 Jan 25 - First Prerelease of 0.7.0 (0.7.0pre1) </h2>

    <p>A new ability to use any bundle or framework for scripting was added
    (notes  for developers are  <a
    href="http://wiki.gnustep.org/index.php/Advertising%20Scripting%20Capabilities">here</a>).
    Scripting information was moved from the bundle info dictionary into a
    separate file. .stmodules were replaced with plain .bundles. The STModule
    class was removed, conditional GDL2 module installation was added, and
    small improvements and bugfixes were made. 

    <p> <em>Important Note:</em> You have to rebuild and reinstall all modules,
    because the bundle format has changed.



<h2 class=news>2002 Dec 25 - Version 0.6.2 </h2>

    <p>Added parsing of real numbers in Smalltalk. Added two new handy methods
    into the ObjectiveC bundle: <code>selectorsContainingString:</code> 
    returns an array of selectors that contain specified string and
    <code>implementorsOfSelector:</code> returns an array of all classes that
    implement specified selector. Created example language bundle called 
    <em>MyLanguage</em>, see the Languages directory in the package. Added GDL2
    module. Fixed installation issue: removed forced installation to the user's
    home directory. </p>


<h2 class=news>2002 Dec 1 - Fix for These Pages</h2>

<p>  Fixed pages to work with Netscape 4.x. The browser does not support style
sheets correctly as it should, so I have removed them for this kind of browser.
Style-sheet is included with small Java-script that checks for a browser
version. If someone has a better solution, let me know. I do not want to use
tables for the page layout, because they are not for that purpose. </p>

<h2 class=news>2002 Nov 10 - Documentation</h2>

<p>
    Added <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a> link.
</p>

<h2 class=news>2002 Sep 15 - Version 0.6.1</h2>

<p>

    Added two new modules: <em>ObjectiveC</em> and <em>StepTalk</em>. With the
    <em>ObjectiveC</em> module, for examle, one may ask for all methods that an
    object responds to. With the <em>StepTalk</em> module it is possible to
    acces some StepTalk classes. This release also includes few bugfixes and
    code cleanup.

</p>

<h2 class=news>2002 Jun 9 - Version 0.6.0</h2>

<p>

    The illusion of a single objective environment was created with <a
    href="features.html#objectfinders">Object Finders</a>. <a
    href="stshell.html">StepTalk shell</a>, an interactive tool for
    communicating with objects, was added. Automated loading of modules an d
    finders is now possible, using scripting environment descriptions. The
    StepTalk defaults were changed. Some source documentation was added.
    Bugfixes were made in the Smalltalk language.

</p>

<h2 class=news>2002 May 13 - StepTalk is an official part of the GNUstep project</h2>

<p>

    <em>StepTalk</em> is now an official part of the GNUstep project.  It was
    also included in the GNUstep <a href=download.html#cvs>CVS repository</a>.


</p>

<h2 class=news>2002 Apr 13 - StepTalk 0.5.2 and AppTalk 0.2.0</h2>

<p>

    <em>AppTalk</em> - Created scripting support bundle, so application does
        not have to be linked with StepTalk library. Bundles loaded by the
        application now can provide additional scripts and additional scripting
        capabilities (new objects). Application is looking for scripting
        information and scripts in all loaded bundles. Updated documentation
        about script search locations and about optional scripting using
        bundle. Created scripting support  <a
        href="Download/ScriptingSupport.m">file</a>.

    <br>

    <em>StepTalk</em> - Removed AppTalk sources and added an option to 'make'
           that disables building of AppKit stuff.


</p>


<h2 class=news>2002 Apr 10 - version 0.5.1</h2>

<p>

    Added <a href="apptalk.html">AppTalk</a> application scripting library.

<h2 class=news>2002 Feb 5 - version 0.5.0</h2>

<p>

    Added support for ranges, points and sizes (see example <em>range.st</em>).
    Implemented selector handling (see examples <em>selector.st</em> and 
    <em>notification.st</em>). Created new example <em>pldes.st</em> from
    GNUstep pldes tool.

    <br>

    <em>Smalltalk:</em> Small (10-15%) speed improvements of block evaluation.
    Handle 'exit' method in script object. 'self exit' will terminate script 
    execution. Added some documentation of Smalltalk features.

</p>

<h2 class=news>2002 Jan 21 - version 0.4.1</h2>

<p>
    Guile - new language bundle. You need step-guile to use
    it.  Created separate Foundation module to provide Foundation constants.
    Some bugs were fixed.
</p>

<h2 class=news>2002 Jan 9 - version 0.4.0</h2>

<p>
    Created new module for using AppKit and added some examples:
    <em>openPanel</em> - shows NSOpenPanel and <em>rtf2text</em> - converts RTF

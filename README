gnustep CVS www module - the www.gnustep.org source code

The site is kept in CVS as xhtml 1.0 files. This is a legacy
of the time when we had lots of mirrors, including www.gnu.org,
and we've not found enough time to change it yet. For now, sed
can be used to effect site-wide changes. See TODO when it exists
for a plan of how we get out of here.

The top-level directories are:

developers/ - the developer pages
experience/ - the new user and new developer pages
information/ - background information common to both
resources/ - downloads and auto-generated files
images/ - some site images
scripts/ - old site maintenance scripts
UserSuite/ - Artwork project

<h1>Objective-C is Fun</h1>
<h5>by Adam Fedor</h5>
<p>Objective-C is a language based upon C, with a few additions
that make it a complete, object-oriented language. Why do I think
Objective-C is fun? Precisely because of this emphasis on
simplicity. Absolutely nothing was added to the language unless it
really made a big improvement on the useability of Objective-C.
Fun, of course, can also lead to danger. And there is plenty to
beware of with Objective-C. Since Objective-C doesn't try to
improve the C language, you have to deal with all the faults and
caveats of C. In addition, the philosophy of Objective-C is to
allow for a great deal of flexibility, leaving the programmer to
watch out for potential problems rather than forcing various
restrictions. For instance, Objective-C provides an object
definition that is completely untyped. This is the <em>id</em>
variable type, which stands for any object. With this type, you can
send a message to any object, without knowing at all what the
object is or what it can do.</p>
<p>Like C, this flexibility allows you to perform great tricks,
while forcing the programmer to introduce his own conventions to
prevent errors. But, ahh, there is fun in danger, isn't there?</p>
<p>Note: In the following article, I describe a particular variant
of Objective-C known as OpenStep (or GNUstep, the free
implementation of OpenStep). This is by far the most popular
implementation of Objective-C (there is no standard Objective-C
language yet...).</p>
<h2>An Introduction</h2>
In truth, there is actually only one syntax addition to the
language -- the syntax for sending a message to an object:
<pre>
<code>
  [anObject doSomethingWith: anotherObject];
</code>
</pre>
This statement simply sends the message <b>doSomethingWith:</b> to
<em>anObject</em>, with an argument of <em>anotherObject</em>. An
Objective-C message call can be used anywhere a C statement can be
used, such as in a conditional statement or within another
Objective-C message. On compilers that support it, Objective-C
messages can be mixed in C++ code, allowing the programmer to pick
and choose the best aspects of either language.
<p>In addition, there are some keywords that have been added to
allow for the definition and implementation of classes, such as the
definition for the class of which <em>anObject</em> is a
member:</p>
<pre>
<code>
@interface MyClass : NSObject
{
  int aVariable;
  id  subObject;
}

+ alloc;
+ defaultObject;

- init;
- (int) doSomethingWith: (id)anotherObject;

@end
</code>
</pre>
<p>Here, <em>@interface</em> tells the compiler we are defining an
interface for the class named <em>MyClass</em>, which is a subclass
of the class <em>NSObject</em>. <em>NSObject</em> is the root class
used by GNUstep (The traditional Objective-C root class
<em>Object</em>, is not used at all in GNUstep, although it is
available). The root class is not a subclass of any other class.
Although it is not required that a class descend from a root class
like <em>NSObject</em>, this hierarchy is so firmly ingrained in
the language, that it is rare to see classes that are a root class
by themselves. The root class contains some of the most basic and
often used functionality, which gives you the advantage of knowing
that all your classes will responds to these basic messages. Out of
the 300 or so classes in the GNUstep core library, only two are
root classes.</p>
<p>The curly brackets after the class definition enclose the data
that is encapsulated in the class. These variables are called
<em>instance variables</em>, because they are variables that belong
to an <em>instance</em> of a class.</p>
<p>The rest of the interface defines the methods implemented by the
class. A method is a description of a message a class responds to.
A '<b>+</b>' indicates a class method. Class methods are often
called <em>factory</em> methods, because typically a factory method
is used to create or <em>manufacture</em> instances of the class.
The most popular class method is <em>alloc</em>, which allocates
space for an instance of the class (but does not initialize the
class -- that is usually reserved for the instance method
<em>init</em>). A '<b>-</b>' indicates an instance method. For
example, the <b>doSomethingWith:</b> method defined above takes one
argument, the object <em>anotherObject</em>, and returns an
integer. Class messages can only be sent to a class. Instance
messages can only be sent to an instance of a class.</p>
<h2>Dynamic Binding</h2>
<p>Objective-C is a language that implements true <em>dynamic
binding</em> (which is required for a language to be truly
object-oriented). This means that messages sent to an object aren't
<em>bound</em> to a specific function implementation in a specific
class until the program is actually run. Stating this another way,
the programmer does not know how an object will <em>react</em> to a
specific message until the program is actually run.</p>
<p>Dynamic binding comes about because in every Objective-C
program, there is a <em>runtime</em> that works behind the scenes
to connect a specific message with a specific object. Every time a
message like <b>doSomethingWith:</b> is sent to an object, the
Objective-C runtime looks up the definition of the class of the
object, finds the function (method) that corresponds to the message
<b>doSomethingWith:</b>, and then calls that function.</p>
<p>It may seem like this type of lookup could really slow a program
down. In practice, however, most runtimes are optimized for this
sort of lookup, and in general, it can be shown that message lookup
is often not the dominant time factor of a program (particularly in
GUI programs). Anywhere that time is critical, it's possible in
Objective-C to <em>pre-bind</em> a message to its implementation,
thus avoiding the expensive message lookup.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of a method definition, is that once a
method is defined, that method name and definition are, in a sense
<em>global</em>, and can be used anywhere. For instance, say I had
an object <em>newObject</em> that did not recognize the
<b>doSomethingWith:</b> message. Well I could send the message to
the object anyway, and the compiler would not complain about
it:</p>
<pre>
<code>
  id newObject;                               // could be any object;
  newObject = [[NewObject alloc] init];       // create and initialize the object
  [newObject doSomethingWith: anotherObject]; // send it a message.
</code>
</pre>
<p>Only when the program was run would the Objective-C runtime
discover that newObject did not recognize the
<b>doSomethingWith:</b> message. However, instead of immediately
issuing an error, the runtime instead sends another message to
newObject, called the <em>forwardInvocation:</em> message. This
gives newObject a chance to handle messages sent to it that it
doesn't understand. In this case, if newObject knew about anObject,
it could forward the message on to anObject and let it handle the
message:</p>
<pre>
<code>
- (void) forwardInvocation: (NSInvocation*)anInvocation
{
  if ([anObject respondsToSelector: [anInvocation selector]])
    return [anInvocation invokeWithTarget: anObject];
  else
    return [self doesNotRecognizeSelector: [anInvocation selector]];
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>Here, the variable <em>self</em> refers to the object which
received the message (similar to the <em>this</em> variable in
C++). <em>anInvocation</em> is another object which contains all
the information about the message that was sent, including the name
of the message (the <em>selector</em>) and any arguments.</p>
<p>This type of usage is called delegation, and it is a powerful
method of implementing various different constructs such as
multiple inheritance, journaling, and dispatching messages to
dynamically loaded code.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there are proper ways to handle unrecognized
message, using Protocols, that allow for compile time checking and
more robust code. Most programmers avoid defining un-typed objects
unless it's really useful. A better way to write the first code
segment would be:</p>
<pre>
<code>
  NewObject *newObject;                 // newObject will be an instance of the NewObject class
  newObject = [[NewObject alloc] init]; // create and initialize the object
  [newObject doSomethingWith: anotherObject];
</code>
</pre>
<p>In this case, the compiler would issue a warning stating that
newObject does not respond to the message
<b>doSomethingWith:</b>.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>I've already given an example of how to implement a method with
the <em>forwardInvocation:</em> method. That example wasn't
entirely correct. In Objective-C, a method implementation must be
associated with a certain class by enclosing the implementation
between the keywords <em>@implementation</em> and
<em>@end</em>.</p>
<pre>
<code>
@implementation MyClass

- (int) doSomethingWith: anotherObject
{
 return [anotherObject multiply: 3 by: 4];
}

@end
</code>
</pre>
<p>The <em>@implementation</em> keyword, is a counterpart to the
<em>@interface</em> keyword (Note that it is not necessary to
indicate that MyClass is a subclass of NSObject. The compiler
already knows this from the interface definition). You can
implement as many methods as you like within an
<em>@implementation</em> block (even methods that were not
described in the class interface).</p>
<p>Methods that are implemented in the implementation section but
are not described in the interface become, in essence, private
methods that can only be used by that class and not by another
class.</p>
<h2>Power through Customization</h2>
<p>One of the most frustrating aspects of using classes written by
other people is that these classes often don't contain some key
functionality that you need. One way to add this functionality
(assuming you don't have the source to the original class, or don't
want to change it for some other reason), is to simply make a
subclass and implement the methods you need in that class. But this
creates another problem. Now you have to tell everyone else to use
your particular subclass and not the original class. Or what if
someone else has already subclassed this class and added different
functionality. How do you combine the two subclasses?</p>
<p>Objective-C provides a very simple and elegant way to add
functionality to an existing class using <em>Categories</em>. A
category is defined simply with an <em>@interface</em> line and the
name of the category (e.g. MyAdditionalMethods):</p>
<pre>
<code>
@interface MyClass (MyAdditionalMethods)
- (int) doSomethingWith: thisObject andThenWith: thatObject;
@end
</code>
</pre>
<p>The additional methods are then implemented in a complementary
<em>@implementation</em> section. There is one restriction,
however. You can't define additional instance variables, which
would change the amount of data held by the class. Other than this
restriction, the things you can do with categories is incredible
(and bizarre). For instance, if a method is defined both in the
main class interface and a category, the category implementation
wins. A message sent to the class will use the category
implementation and ignore the original class implementation. If a
method is defined in two separate categories, the implementation
that is used is indeterminate, since you never know which category
will be loaded first. In a situation where dynamic loading is used,
this sort of behavior can create all sorts of headaches for a
security conscious programmer...</p>
<p>Most often, however, categories are used to implement additional
functionality that may be useful to only one part of the program.
For instance, some additional methods may be defined to allow a
class to better interact with the GUI section of the program, or
the distributed objects section of the program.</p>
<h2>And More...</h2>
<p>I've only touched on a few of the features of Objective-C. I
also haven't answered a lot of typical first-time Objective-C user
questions, like why is the allocation of space for a class
(<b>alloc</b>) separated from the initialization of the class
(<b>init</b>)? How do you get rid of an object once your done with
it (garbage collecting)? Future articles might tackle these
questions.</p>
<p>To learn more, I'd encourage you to visit the GNUstep home page
(<a href="http://www.gnustep.org">www.gnustep.org</a>) or the Apple
Developers page ( <a href=
"http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosxserver/macosxserver.html">
http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosxserver/macosxserver.html</a>)
to look for more documentation on the Objective-C language and the
OpenStep libraries.</p>
<h2>Future Topics:</h2>

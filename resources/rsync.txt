I've placed the needed binaries and config files to use GNUstep and 
GNUstep web on distro.nfox.com.

I build GNUstep and GSWeb as needed, and this build includes our 
internal changes, some of which I haven't folded back in yet.  I also 
review changes to the CVS tree before I accept them into the working 
copy, so in some cases this is slightly behind the CVS working source. 
 We have always placed this build onto an internal rsync server so 
that each member of our team doesn't have to build GNUstep each day.


I've now extended this to copy our private rsync server to the public 
rsync server.  The binaries include some misc bins that don't come 
with redhat that we use around here.  The build takes place at 6AM 
Pacific Time.  The rsync takes place 1 hour later.  

The public rsync server is open 24 hours a day. Enjoy.

I will be writing up more detailed  directions on how to install and 
use this later, but here is the short version:


To get the binaries:

First, get the update script.

cd /usr/GNUstep   # make it if needed
rsync -vaz distro.nfox.com::GNUstep/RedHat/i686/current/update ./

>From then on, you can just run /usr/GNUstep/update to grab the latest 
copy.

In /usr/GNUstep/misc/template/user  is a .cshrc that has all the 
needed environment variables.  Either use directly or copy and paste 
as desired.

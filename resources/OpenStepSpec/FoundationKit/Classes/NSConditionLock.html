<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSConditionLock objects are used to lock and unlock threads when specified
conditions occur.<p>
<p>
The user of an NSConditionLock object can lock when a process enters a
particular state and can set the state to something else when releasing the
lock. The states are defined by the lock's user. NSConditionLock is well suited
to synchronizing different modules such as a producer and a consumer where the
two modules must share data, but the consumer must sleep until a condition is
met such as more data being available.<p>
<p>
The NSConditionLock class provides four ways of locking its objects
(<b>lock</b>,<b> lockWhenCondition:</b>,<b> tryLock</b>, and
<b>tryLockWhenCondition</b>) and two ways of unlocking (<b>unlock </b>and<b>
unlockWithCondition:</b>). Any combination of locking method and unlocking
method is legal. <p>
<p>
The following example shows how the producer-consumer problem might be handled
using condition locks. The producer need not wait for a condition, but must
wait for the lock to be made available so it can safely create shared data. For
example, a producer could use a lock this way:<p>
<p>
<tt>/* create the lock only once */</tt><p>
<tt>id condLock = [NSConditionLock new];</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>[condLock lock];</tt><p>
<tt>/* Manipulate global data... */</tt><p>
<tt>[condLock unlockWithCondition:HAS_DATA];</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
Multiple consumer threads can then lock until there's data available and
everyone is out of locked critical sections. In the following code sample, the
consumer sleeps until the producer invokes <b>unlockWithCondition:</b> with the
parameter HAS_DATA:<p>
<p>
<tt>[condLock lockWhenCondition:HAS_DATA];</tt><p>
<tt>/* Manipulate global data if necessary... */</tt><p>
<tt>[condLock unlockWithCondition:(moreData ? HAS_DATA : NO_DATA)];</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
An NSConditionLock object doesn't busy-wait, so it can be used to lock
time-consuming operations without degrading system performance.<p>
<p>
The NSConditionLock, NSLock, and NSRecursiveLock classes all implement the
NSLocking protocol with various features and performance characteristics; see
the other class descriptions for more information.<p>

<b>Initializing an NSConditionLock</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (id)<b>initWithCondition:</b>(int)<i>condition</i>	Initializes a newly
created NSConditionLock and sets its condition to <i>condition</i>.</LI></UL>
<b>Returning the Condition</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (int)<b>condition</b>	Returns the receiver's condition, the state that must
be achieved before a conditional lock can be acquired or released.</LI></UL>
<b>Acquiring and Releasing a Lock</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>lockWhenCondition:</b>(int)<i>condition</i>	Attempts to acquire a
lock when <i>condition</i> is met. Blocks until <i>condition</i> is met.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>unlockWithCondition:</b>(int)<i>condition</i>	Releases the lock and
sets lock state to <i>condition</i>.
</LI><LI> -  (BOOL)<b>tryLock</b>	Attempts to acquire a lock. Returns YES if successful
and NO otherwise.
</LI><LI> -  (BOOL)<b>tryLockWhenCondition:</b>(int)<i>condition</i>	Attempts to acquire a
lock when <i>condition</i> is met. Returns YES if successful and NO
otherwise.

<b>Class Description</b><p>


The NSMutableCharacterSet class declares the programmatic interface to objects
that construct mutable <i>descriptions</i> of character sets in the UniCode
character encoding. Having constructed such character set descriptions using
methods described in the NSCharacterSet class, you can use the methods
described here to modify the character sets dynamically. <p>
<p>

<b>Adding and Removing Characters</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>addCharactersInRange:</b>(NSRange)<i>aRange</i>	Adds to the receiver
the Unicode characters whose values are given by <i>aRange</i>.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>addCharactersInString:</b>(NSString *)<i>aString</i>	Adds the
characters in <i>aString</i> to those in the receiver.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>removeCharactersInRange:</b>(NSRange)<i>aRange</i>	
	Removes from the receiver the Unicode characters whose values are given by
<i>aRange</i>.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>removeCharactersInString:</b>(NSString *)<i>aString</i>
<i></i>	Removes from the receiver the characters in <i>aString</i>.</LI></UL>
<b>Combining Character Sets</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>formIntersectionWithCharacterSet:</b>(NSCharacterSet
*)<i>otherSet</i>	
	Modifies the receiver so that it contains only those characters that exist in
both the receiver and in <i>otherSet</i>.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>formUnionWithCharacterSet:</b>(NSCharacterSet *)<i>otherSet</i>
<i></i>	Modifies the receiver so that it contains all characters that exist in
either the receiver or <i>otherSet</i>, barring duplicates.</LI></UL>
<b>Inverting a Character Set</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>invert</b>	Replaces all of the characters in the receiver with all
the characters it didn't previously contain.

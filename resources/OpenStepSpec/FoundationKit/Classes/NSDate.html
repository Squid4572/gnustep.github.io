<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSDate is an abstract class that provides behavior for creating dates,
comparing dates, representing dates, computing time intervals, and similar
functionality. It presents a programmatic interface through which suitable date
objects are requested and returned. NSDate objects are lightweight and
immutable since they represent a invariant point in time. This class is
designed to provide the foundation for arbitrary calendrical representations.
Its subclass NSCalendarDate offers date objects that are suitable for
representing dates according to western calendrical systems.<p>
<p>
Date as used above implies clock time as well.
The standard unit of time for date objects is a value typed as NSTimeInterval
(a <b>double</b>) and expressed as seconds. The NSTimeInterval type makes
possible a wide and fine-grained range of date and time values, giving accuracy
within milliseconds for dates 10,000 years apart.<p>
<p>
NSDate and its subclasses compute time as seconds <i>relative</i> to an
absolute reference date. This reference date is the first instant of January 1,
2001. NSDate converts all date and time representations to and from
NSTimeInterval values that are relative to this absolute reference date. A
positive interval relative to a date represents a point in the future, a
negative interval represents a time in the past.<p>
<p>
<b>Note:  </b>Conventional UNIX systems implement time according to the Network
Time Protocol (NTP) standard, which is based on Coordinated Universal Time. The
private implementation of NSDate follows the NTP standard. However, this
standard doesn't account for leap seconds and therefore isn't synchronized with
International Atomic Time (the most accurate).<p>
<p>
<p>
Like various other Foundation classes, NSDate lets you obtain operating-system
functionality (dates and times) without depending on operating-system
internals. It also provides a basis for the NSRunLoop and NSTimer classes,
which use concrete date objects to implement local event loops and timers. <p>
<p>
NSDate's sole primitive method, <b>timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate</b>, provides
the basis for all the other methods in the NSDate interface. It returns a time
value relative to an absolute reference date.<p>
<p>

<b>Using NSDate</b><p>

The date objects dispensed by NSDate give you a diverse range of date and time
functionality. To obtain dates, send one of the <b>date...</b> messages to the
NSDate class object. One of the most useful is <b>date</b> itself, which
returns a date object representing the current date and time. You can get new
date objects with date and time values adjusted from existing date objects by
sending <b>addTimeInterval:</b>.<p>
<p>
You can obtain relative date information by sending the <b>timeInterval...</b>
messges to a date object. For instance, <b>timeIntervalSinceNow</b> gives you
the time, in seconds, between the current time and the receiving date object.
Compare dates with the <b>isEqual:</b>, <b>compare:</b>, <b>laterDate:</b>, and
<b>earlierDate:</b> methods and use the <b>description </b>method to obtain a
string object that represents the date in a standard international format.<p>

<b>Creating an NSDate Object </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (id)<b>allocWithZone:</b>(NSZone *)<i>zone</i>	Allocates an unitialized
NSDate in <i>zone</i>. Returns <b>nil</b> if allocation fails.
</LI><LI> +  (NSDate *)<b>date</b>	Creates and returns an NSDate set to the current date
and time.
</LI><LI> +  (NSDate
*)<b>dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:</b>(NSTimeInterval)<i>seconds</i>
<i></i>	Creates and returns an NSDate set to <i>seconds</i> seconds from the
current date and time.
</LI><LI> +  (NSDate
*)<b>dateWithTimeIntervalSince1970:</b>(NSTimeInterval)<i>seconds</i>
<i></i>	Creates and returns an NSDate set to to <i>seconds</i> seconds from the
reference date used by UNIX<sup>(R) </sup>systems. Use a negative argument
value to specify a date and time before the reference date.
</LI><LI> +  (NSDate
*)<b>dateWithTimeIntervalSinceReferenceDate:</b>(NSTimeInterval)<i>seconds</i><p
<i></i>	Creates and returns an NSDate set to <i>seconds</i> seconds from the
absolute reference date (the first instant of 1 January, 2001). Use a negative
argument value to specify a date and time before the reference date.
</LI><LI> +  (NSDate *)<b>distantFuture</b>	Creates and returns an NSDate that represents
a date in the distant future (in terms of centuries). You can use this object
in your code as a control date, a guaranteed outer temporal limit.
</LI><LI> +  (NSDate *)<b>distantPast</b>	Creates and returns an NSDate that represents a
date in the distant past (in terms of centuries). You can use this object in
your code as a control date, a guaranteed temporal boundary.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>init</b>	Initializes a newly allocated NSDate to the current date and
time.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>initWithString:</b>(NSString *)<i>description</i>	Returns an NSDate
with a date and time value specified by the international string-representation
format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS -HHMM, where -HHMM is a time zone offset in hours
and minutes from Greenwich Mean Time.
</LI><LI> -  (NSDate *)<b>initWithTimeInterval:</b>(NSTimeInterval)<i>seconds</i>
<i></i><b>sinceDate:</b>(NSDate *)<i>anotherDate</i>	Returns an NSDate
initialized relative to another date object by <i>seconds</i> (plus or
minus).
</LI><LI> -  (NSDate
*)<b>initWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:</b>(NSTimeInterval)<i>seconds</i>
<i></i>	Returns an NSDate initialized relative to the current date and time by
<i>seconds</i> (plus or minus).
</LI><LI> - 
(id)<b>initWithTimeIntervalSinceReferenceDate:</b>(NSTimeInterval)<i>seconds</i>p>
<i></i>	Returns an NSDate initialized relative to the reference date and time
by <i>seconds</i> (plus or minus).</LI></UL>
<b>Converting to an NSCalendar Object</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSCalendarDate *)<b>dateWithCalendarFormat:</b>(NSString
*)<i>formatString</i>
<i></i><b>timeZone:</b>(NSTimeZone *)<i>timeZone</i>	Returns an NSCalendarDate
object bound to the format string <i>formatString</i> and the time zone
<i>timeZone</i>. If you specify <b>nil</b> after either or both of these
arguments, the default format string and time zone are assumed.</LI></UL>
<b>Representing Dates</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSString *)<b>description</b>	Returns a string representation of the
receiver. The representation conforms to the international format YYYY-MM-DD
HH:MM:SS -HHMM, where -HHMM represents the time-zone offset in hours and
minutes from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
</LI><LI> -  (NSString *)<b>descriptionWithCalendarFormat:</b>(NSString
*)<i>formatString</i>
<i></i><b>timeZone</b>:(NSTimeZone *)<i>aTimeZone	</i>Returns a string
representation of the receiver. The
<b>locale:</b>(NSDictionary *)<i>localeDictionary</i>		representation conforms
to <i>formatString</i> (a <b>strftime</b>-style date-conversion string) and is
adjusted to <i>aTimeZone</i>. Included are the keys and values that represent
the locale data from <i>localeDictionary</i>.
</LI><LI> -  (NSString *)<b>descriptionWithLocale:</b>(NSDictionary

<i></i>	Returns a string representation of receiver (see <b>description</b>).
Included are the key and values that represent the locale data from
<i>localeDictionary</i>.</LI></UL>
<b>Adding and Getting Intervals</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSTimeInterval)<b>timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate</b>	
	Returns the interval between the system's absolute reference date and the
current date and time. This value is less than zero until the first instant of
1 January 2001.

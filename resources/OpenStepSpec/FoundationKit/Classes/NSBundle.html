<b>Class Description</b><p>


A <i>bundle</i> is a mechanism for grouping application <i>resources</i> into
convenient chunks. A typical (but by no means the only) application of a bundle
is to group executable code together with the resources used by that executable
code. A major use of bundles is to handle localization issues, as described
below in Localized Resources.<p>
<p>
An NSBundle is an object that corresponds to a directory (or folder in the
terminology of some operating systems) where application resources are stored.
The directory, in essence, bundles a set of
resources used by an application, and the NSBundle object makes those resources
available to the application. NSBundle is able to find requested resources in
the directory and, in some cases, dynamically load executable code. The term
bundle is used both for the object and for the
directory it represents.<p>
<p>
Bundled resources might include such things as:<p>
<p>
.	ImagesTIFF or EPS (for instance) images used by an application's user
interface components<p>
<p>
.	Sounds<p>
<p>
.	Localized character strings<p>
<p>
.	Executable code<p>
<p>
.	User Interface resourcesfiles describing the layout of user interface
objects and their relationships with other objects<p>
<p>
Each resource within a bundle usually resides in a separate file. <p>
<p>

<b>Localized Resources</b><p>


If an application is to be used in more than one part of the world, its
resources may need to be customized, or
localized, for language, country, or cultural
region. An application may need, for example, to have separate Japanese,
English, French, Hindi, and Swedish versions of the character strings that
label menu commands.<p>
<p>
Resource files specific to a particular language are grouped together in a
subdirectory of the bundle directory. The subdirectory has the name of the
language (in English) followed by a .lproj
extension (for language project). The
application mentioned above, for example, would have <b>Japanese.lproj</b>,
<b>English.lproj</b>, <b>French.lproj</b>, <b>Hindi.lproj</b>, and
<b>Swedish.lproj</b> subdirectories.<p>
<p>
Each .lproj subdirectory in a bundle has the
same set of files; all versions of a resource file must have the same name.<p>
<p>

<b>The Main Bundle</b><p>


Every application is considered to have at least one bundleits <i>main
bundle</i>the directory where its executable file is located. If the
application is organized into a file package marked by a
.app extension, the file package is the main
bundle.<p>
<p>

<b>Other Bundles</b><p>


An application can be organized into any number of other bundles in addition to
the main bundle. For example, an application for managing PostScript printers
may have a bundle full of PostScript code to be downloaded to printers.These
other bundles usually reside inside the application file package, but they can
be located anywhere in the file system. Each bundle directory is represented in
the application by a separate NSBundle object.<p>
<p>
By convention, bundle directories other than the main bundle end in a
.bundle extension.<p>
<p>

<b>Dynamically Loadable Classes</b><p>


Any bundle directory can contain a file with executable code. For the main
bundle, that file is the application executable that's loaded into memory when
the application is launched. The executable in the main bundle includes the
<b>main()</b> function and other code necessary to start up the application.<p>
<p>
Executable files in other bundle directories hold class (and category)
definitions that the Bundle object can dynamically load while the application
runs. When asked, the Bundle returns class objects for the classes (and
categories) stored in the file. It waits to load the file until those classes
are needed.<p>
<p>
By using a number of separate bundles, you can split an application into
smaller, more manageable pieces. Each piece is loaded into memory only when the
code being executed requires it, so the application can start up faster than it
otherwise would. And, assuming users will rarely exercise every part of an
application, the application will also consume less memory as it runs.<p>
<p>
The file that contains dynamically loadable code must have the same name as the
bundle directory, but without the .bundle
extension.<p>
<p>
Since each bundle can have only one executable file, that file should be kept
free of localizable content. Anything that needs to be localized should be
segregated into separate resource files and stored in
.lproj subdirectories.<p>
<p>

<b>Working with Bundles</b><p>


Generally, you instantiate a bundle object by sending one of the
<b>bundleForClass:</b>, <b>bundleWithPath:</b>, or <b>mainBundle</b> methods to
the NSBundle class object. <b>mainBundle</b> gives you the NSBundle object
corresponding to the directory containing the application's executable.<p>
<p>

<b>Initializing an NSBundle </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (id)<b>initWithPath:</b>(NSString *)<i>path</i>	Initializes a newly allocated
NSBundle object to make it the NSBundle for the <i>path</i> directory.</LI></UL>
<b>Getting an NSBundle </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSBundle *)<b>bundleForClass:</b>(Class)<i>aClass</i>	Returns the NSBundle
object that dynamically loaded <i>aClass</i>, or the main bundle object if
<i>aClass</i> wasn't dynamically loaded.
</LI><LI> +  (NSBundle *)<b>bundleWithPath:</b>(NSString *)<i>path</i>	Returns an NSBundle
object that's initialized for the <i>path</i> directory.
</LI><LI> +  (NSBundle *)<b>mainBundle</b>	Returns the NSBundle object that corresponds to
the directory where the application executable is located.</LI></UL>
<b>Getting a Bundled Class </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (Class)<b>classNamed:</b>(NSString *)<i>className</i>	Returns the class
object for the <i>className</i> class, or <b>nil</b> if <i>className</i> isn't
one of the classes associated with the receiver.
</LI><LI> -  (Class)<b>principalClass</b>	Returns the class object for the <i>first</i>
class that's dynamically loaded by the NSBundle, or <b>nil</b> if the NSBundle
can't dynamically load any classes.</LI></UL>
<b>Finding a Resource </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSString *)<b>pathForResource:</b>(NSString *)<i>name</i>	Returns the path
for the resource identified by <i>name</i>,
<b>ofType:</b>(NSString *)<i>ext</i>		having the specified filename
<i>ext</i>,
<b>inDirectory:</b>(NSString *)<i>bundlePath</i>		residing in
<i>bundlePath,</i>
<i></i><b>withVersion:</b>(int)<i>version</i>		and having version number
<i>version</i>.
</LI><LI> -  (NSString *)<b>pathForResource:</b>(NSString *)<i>name</i>	Returns the path
for the resource identified by <i>name</i>
<i></i><b>ofType:</b>(NSString *)<i>ext</i>		having the specified filename
extension <i>ext</i>.</LI></UL>
<b>Getting the Bundle Directory </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSString *)<b>bundlePath</b>	Returns a string containing the full pathname
of the receiver's bundle directory.</LI></UL>
<b>Stripping Symbols</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (void)<b>stripAfterLoading:</b>(BOOL)<i>flag</i>	Sets whether symbols are
stripped when modules are loaded. The default is YES. You would usually set
<i>flag</i> to NO for debugging purposes.</LI></UL>
<b>Managing Localized Resources</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSString *)<b>localizedStringForKey:</b>(NSString *)<i>key</i>	
<b>value:</b>(NSString *)<i>value</i>	Returns a localized version of the string
designated by 
<b>table:</b>(NSString *)<i>tableName		key</i>.<i> tableName </i>specifies the
string table to search; if 
		<i>tableName</i> is NULL, the file <b>Localizable.strings</b> is<i>
</i>used.<i> value</i> specifies the value to return if the key or table can't
be found (or if <i>key</i> is NULL).</LI></UL>
<b>Setting the Version </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (unsigned)<b>bundleVersion</b>	Returns the version last set by the
<b>setBundleVersion:</b> method, or 0 if no version has been set.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>setBundleVersion:</b>(unsigned)<i>version</i>	Sets the version that
the NSBundle will use when searching .lproj
subdirectories for resource files.

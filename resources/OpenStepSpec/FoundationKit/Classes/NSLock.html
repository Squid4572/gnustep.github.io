<b>Class Description</b><p>


An NSLock is used to protect critical regions of code. A lock is created once
and is subsequently used to protect one or more regions of code. If a region of
code is in use, an NSLock waits using the <b>condition_wait()</b> function, so
the thread doesn't busy-wait. The following example shows the use of an NSLock
with the methods <b>lock</b> and <b>unlock</b> defined in the NSLocking
protocol:<p>
<p>
<tt>NSLock  *theLock = [NSLock new];       // done once!</tt><p>
<tt>/* ... other code */</tt><p>
<tt>[theLock lock];</tt><p>
<tt>/* ... possibly a long time of fussing with global data... */</tt><p>
<tt>[theLock unlock];</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
The NSConditionLock, NSLock, and NSRecursiveLock classes all implement the
NSLocking protocol with various features and performance characteristics; see
the other class descriptions for more information.<p>
<p>

<b>Acquiring a Lock</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (BOOL)<b>tryLock</b>	Attempts to acquire a lock. Returns YES if successful
and NO otherwise. Returns immediately.

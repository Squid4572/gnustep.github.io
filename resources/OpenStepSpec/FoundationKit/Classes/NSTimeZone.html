<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSTimeZone is an abstract class that defines the behavior of time-zone objects.
By itself, NSDate represents dates as <i>universal time</i>. Universal time
treats a date and time value as identical in, for instance, Redwood City and
New York City. NSDate has no provision for locale adjustment of time-zone
information. Provision for locale is critical for string descriptions and other
expressions of conventional dates and times. NSTimeZone is used to affect the
apparent value of date objects so that they reflect time zone related locale
information.<p>
<p>
NSTimeZoneDetail, a public subclass of NSTimeZone, augments the behavior of
NSTimeZone by providing the commonly known attributes of a time zone in effect
for a date within a time zone geopolitical area. These attributes are
abbreviation, the offset from GMT (universal time), and an indication of
whether Daylight Savings Time is in effect.<p>
<p>
Time-zone objects represent geopolitical regions and use names to denote the
various regions. For example, US/Pacific
identifies the geopolitical time zone for San Francisco and Los Angeles, which
falls in the same general latitude as that for the time zone
Canada/Pacific. The US/Pacific time-zone has
specific NSTimeZoneDetail instances that specify PST (Pacific Standard Time)
and PDT (Pacific Daylight Time), which have slightly different offsets from
GMT.<p>
<p>
You typically associate the objects returned by NSTimeZone (and, by extension,
NSTimeZoneDetail) with date objects to affect their behavior. Time-zone objects
can be of various types:<p>
<p>
.	time zones with hour and minute offsets from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)<p>
<p>
.	time zones with a single abbreviation and offset<p>
<p>
.	time zones that vary according to Standard Time and Daylight Savings Time<p>
<p>
The system should supply the various choices for time zones along with
time-zone information. These choices should be restricted to subsets based on
latitude. You can access these choices through the <b>timeZoneArray</b> class
method. Another restriction is the choice of time zone available when there is
an ambiguous abbreviation; these choices are available through the class method
<b>abbreviationDictionary</b>. Despite these restrictions, you can obtain an
NSTimeZone object from an arbitrary file through the class method
<b>timeZoneWithName</b>.<p>
<p>
<b>Note:  </b>By itself, the NSTimeZone class only <i>names</i> a time zone. It
does not associate an abbreviation or a temporal offset with a time zone; that
is done by NSTimeZoneDetail. An instance of NSTimeZone, however,
knows about the set of time-zone detail objects
related to it.<p>
<p>
<p>
NSTimeZone provides several class methods to get time-zone objects, with or
without detail: <b>timeZoneWithName:</b>, <b>timeZoneWithAbbreviation:</b>, and
<b>timeZoneForSecondsFromGMT:</b>. The class also permits you to set the
default time zone used by your application for your locale
(<b>setDefaultTimeZone:</b>) You can access this default time zone at any time
by the <b>defaultTimeZone</b> method, and, with the <b>localTimeZone</b> class
method, you can also get a relative time-zone object that will decode itself to
become the default time zone for any locale in which it finds itself.<p>
<p>
NSCalendarDate methods return date objects that are automatically bound with
time-zone detail objects. These date objects use the functionality of
NSTimeZone to adjust dates for the proper locale. Unless you specify otherwise,
objects returned from NSCalendarDate are bound to the default time zone for the
current locale. A useful instance method is <b>timeZoneDetailForDate:</b>,
which returns a time-zone detail object associated with a specific date.<p>
<p>

<b>Creating and Initializing an NSTimeZone</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSTimeZoneDetail *)<b>defaultTimeZone</b>	Returns the default time zone as
set for the current locale.
</LI><LI> +  (NSTimeZone *)<b>localTimeZone</b>	Returns an NSTimeZone that behaves as the
current default time zone in any given locale.
</LI><LI> +  (NSTimeZone *)<b>timeZoneForSecondsFromGMT:</b>(int)<i>seconds</i>	
	Returns an NSTimeZone representing the time zone with <i>seconds</i> offset
from Greenwich Mean Time. If there is no object matching the offset, this
method creates and returns a new NSTimeZone bearing the value <i>seconds</i> as
a name. 
</LI><LI> +  (NSTimeZoneDetail *)<b>timeZoneWithAbbreviation:</b>(NSString
*)<i>abbreviation</i>
<i></i>	Returns the time-zone object identified by the abbreviation
<i>abbreviation</i>. If there's no match, this method returns <b>nil</b>. 
</LI><LI> +  (NSTimeZone *)<b>timeZoneWithName:</b>(NSString *)<i>aTimeZoneName</i>
<i></i>	Returns the time-zone object with the name that corresponds to the
geopolitical region <i>aTimeZoneName</i>. It searches the regions dictionary
for matching names. If there is no match on the name, this method returns
<b>nil</b>.
</LI><LI> -  (NSTimeZoneDetail *)<b>timeZoneDetailForDate:</b>(NSDate *)<i>date</i>
<i></i>	Returns the correct time-zone detail object associated with a date
object. You invoke this method when a region's time zone (that is, its offset
value from GMT) varies over the year, as happens between Standard Time and
Daylight Savings Time.</LI></UL>
<b>Managing Time Zones</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (void)<b>setDefaultTimeZone:</b>(NSTimeZone *)<i>aTimeZone</i>
<i></i>	Sets <i>aTimeZone</i> as the time zone appropriate for the current
locale. This new time zone replaces the previous default time zone.</LI></UL>
<b>Getting Time Zone Information</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSDictionary *)<b>abbreviationDictionary</b>	Returns a dictionary that maps
abbreviations to region names, for example PST
is the key for US/Pacific. If you know a region
name for a key, you can obtain a valid abbreviation from the dictionary and use
it to obtain a detail time-zone object using
<b>timeZoneWithAbbreviation:</b>.
</LI><LI> -  (NSString *)<b>timeZoneName</b>	Returns the geopolitical name of the time
zone.</LI></UL>
<b>Getting Arrays of Time Zones</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSArray *)<b>timeZoneArray</b>	Returns an array of string object arrays,
each containing strings that show current geopolitical names for each time
zone. The subarrays are grouped by latitudinal region.
</LI><LI> -  (NSArray *)<b>timeZoneDetailArray</b>	Returns an array of NSTimeZoneDetail
objects that are associated with the receiving NSTimeZone object.

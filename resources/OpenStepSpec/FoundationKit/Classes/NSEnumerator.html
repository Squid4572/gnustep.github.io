<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSEnumerator is a simple abstract class whose instances enumerate collections
of other objects. Collection objectssuch as NSSets, NSArrays, and
NSDictionariesprovide NSEnumerator objects that can traverse their
contents. You send <b>nextObject</b> repeatedly to an NSEnumerator to have it
return the next object in the collection. When there are no more objects to
return, <b>nextObject</b> returns <b>nil</b>.<p>
<p>
Collection classes include methods that return an enumerator appropriate to the
type of collection. NSArray has two methods that return an NSEnumerator object,
<b>objectEnumerator</b> and <b>reverseObjectEnumerator</b> (the former
traverses the array starting at its first object, while the latter starts with
the last object and continues backward through the array to the first object).
NSSet's <b>objectEnumerator</b> provides an enumerator for sets. NSDictionary
has two enumerator-providing methods: <b>keyEnumerator</b> and
<b>objectEnumerator</b>.<p>
<p>
<b>Note:  </b>Collections shouldn't be modified during enumeration.
NSEnumerator imposes this restriction to improve enumeration speed.<p>

<b>Traversing a Collection </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (id)<b>nextObject</b>	Returns the next object in the collection being
enumerated (for example, an NSArray or NSDictionary). Returns <b>nil</b> when
the collection has been traversed.

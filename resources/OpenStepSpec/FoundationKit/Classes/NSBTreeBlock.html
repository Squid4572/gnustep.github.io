<b>Class Description</b><p>


An NSBTreeBlock provides ordered, associative storage and retrieval of untyped
data. It identifies and orders data items, called <i>values</i>, by <i>key</i>,
using a comparator function. A companion class, NSBTreeCursor, actually
manipulates the contents of the NSBTreeBlock; NSBTreeBlock only provides the
mechanisms for storing and sorting the key/value pairs.<p>
<p>

<b>Setting Up an NSBTreeBlock</b><p>

An NSBTreeBlock can be used with either a memory-based NSByteStore or an
NSByteStoreFile. The NSByteStore holds the contents of the NSBTreeBlock. Use
NSBTreeBlock with NSByteStoreFile to build persistent databases. An
NSBTreeBlock is initialized as a new client of an NSByteStore using the method
<b>initWithStore:</b> or <b>initWithStore:block:</b>. The NSBTreeBlock takes up
one block in the NSByteStore per key/value pair and one block for each node in
the tree. An NSBTreeBlock will always take up at least one block in the
NSByteStore.<p>
<p>
After the NSBTreeBlock has been initialized, it must have its comparator
function set with the <b>setComparator:context:</b>. A comparator function
takes as arguments two pieces of arbitrary data and their lengths and returns
an integer indicating their ordering relative to one another. A comparator
function is of type (NSBTreeComparator *), which has the form:<p>
<p>
<tt>typedef int NSBTreeComparator(NSData * <i>data1</i>, NSData * <i>data2</i>,
const void *<i>context</i>)</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
where <i>data1</i> and <i>data2</i> are pointers to data and <i>context</i> is
a pointer to blind data that may be used by the comparator function. The
comparator function returns a number less than 0 if <i>data1</i> is considered
less than <i>data2</i>, greater than 0 if <i>data1</i> is considered greater
than <i>data2</i>, and equal to 0 if <i>data1</i> and <i>data2</i> are
considered equal. By default, NSBTreeBlocks compare keys as strings. <p>
<p>

<b>Getting Data Into and Out of an NSBTreeBlock</b><p>

As stated above, NSBTreeBlock simply provides the capacity for associative
storage. An NSBTreeCursor is needed to take advantage of that capacity. An
NSBTreeCursor is like a pointer into the NSBTreeBlock: It can move to specific
positions within the key space and perform operations on the values stored at
those locations, independent of other cursors. See the NSBTreeCursor class
description for more information.<p>
<p>
Multiple NSBTreeCursors may independently access a single NSBTreeBlock. The
actions of one cursor don't affect any of the other cursors in the
NSBTreeBlock, except to the extent that they modify the contents of the
NSBTreeBlock. It is both safe and meaningful to remove a record that another
NSBTreeCursor has just located, as long as the code using the other
NSBTreeCursor anticipates this possibility, as described below. <p>
<p>
In the case of one cursor removing a value that another cursor has just
located, the second cursor will have received an indication from a key-locating
method (for example, <b>moveCursorToKey:</b>) that it has found a key. When it
tries to access the value associated with that key, however, the key may no
longer exist. The cursor will detect the deletion and slide forward to the next
available key if asked to read the value, or it will raise an exception if
asked to remove or write the value. If your code allows multiple cursors to be
concurrently active in a single NSBTreeBlock, it must anticipate this behavior
by handling the exceptions that may be raised and by comparing the key against
the expected value after invoking <b>cursorKey</b>. If one cursor is pointed at
a key and a second cursor removes or adds a key at a different location, it
does not change the position of the first cursor.<p>
<p>

<b>Working With the NSByteStore</b><p>

Since NSBTreeBlock is an NSByteStore client, the transaction model of
NSByteStore applies to changes made to the contents of an NSBTreeBlock. In
particular, you must send the <b>commitTransaction</b> message to the
NSByteStore to have changes to the NSBTreeBlock take effect (and be flushed to
disk for a file-based store). If an NSBTreeBlock is used on a strictly
read-only basis, transaction management can be ignored. <p>
<p>
After an <b>abortTransaction</b>, a cursor may be pointing to a key that no
longer exists. Therefore, you must reposition each cursor using one of the
<b>moveCursor...</b> methods after an <b>abortTransaction</b>.<p>

<b>Creating and Initializing a New NSBTreeBlock Instance </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSBTreeBlock *)<b>btreeBlockWithStore:</b>(NSByteStore *)<i>aStore</i>

</LI><LI> +  (NSBTreeBlock *)<b>btreeBlockWithStore:</b>(NSByteStore *)<i>aStore</i>
<i></i><b>block:</b>(unsigned)<i>aBlock</i>	Returns a new NSBTreeBlock instance
in the designated NSByteStore with <i>aBlock</i> as the root block of the
NSBTreeBlock. If <i>aBlock</i> does not exist or is invalid, the
NSBTreeInitException is raised.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>initWithStore:</b>(NSByteStore *)<i>aStore</i>

NSBTreeBlock instance in the designated NSByteStore with <i>aBlock</i> as the
root block of the NSBTreeBlock. If <i>aBlock</i> does not exist or is invalid,
the NSBTreeInitException is raised.</LI></UL>
<b>Accessing Information About the NSByteStore</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSByteStore *)<b>byteStore</b>	Returns the NSByteStore associated with the

</LI><LI> -  (unsigned)<b>storeBlock</b>	Returns the number of the NSByteStore block that
contains the root of the NSBTreeBlock.</LI></UL>
<b>Setting the Comparator</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>setComparator:</b>(NSBTreeComparator *)<i>comparator</i> 
<b>context:</b>(const void *)<i>context</i>	Sets the comparison method. The
default is string comparison. When a value is inserted in the NSBTreeBlock, the
comparator function decides where to put it. For more information, see the
class description.</LI></UL>
<b>Accessing NSBTreeBlock information</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>removeAllObjects</b>	Removes all key/value pairs from the
NSBTreeBlock.

<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSNotification objects provide a flexible way to transmit event information
between objects.<p>
<p>
Message passinginvoking a methodis the standard way to convey
information between objects. However, this requires the object sending the
message to know who the receiver is. At times this explicit binding of two
objects is undesirablemost notably because it would tie two otherwise
independent subsystems. For these instances, a looser broadcast model is
introduced: An object posts a notification, which is dispatched to the
appropriate receivers through a notification center.<p>
<p>
An object may post an NSNotification object (referred to as a<i> notification
object</i> or simply, a<i> notification</i>), which contains information about
an object: the notification's name, its sender, and an optional dictionary
containing other information. Other objects can register themselves as
observers to receive notification objects when they are posted. When the event
happens, the registered objects receive notifications about it. The object
posting the NSNotification object, the object the notification is about, and
the observer of the notification may all be different objects. <p>
<p>
An NSNotificationCenter object registers observers for events and notifies the
observers if these events occur. An object may ask an NSNotificationCenter
object (also known as a <i>notification center</i>) to observe an event
regarding another object. If the event occurs, the posting object tells the
notification center to notify its observers that this condition has occurred.
The notification center then sends a notification to all observing objects.
(See the class specification of NSNotificationCenter for more on posting
notification objects.)<p>
<p>
This notification model frees an object from concern about what objects may
want to observe it. An object involved with an eventor another
objectmay simply post a notification about that event without knowing
what objectsif anyare observing the event. The notification
center takes care of distributing notifications to registered observers.
Another benefit of this model is to allow multiple objects to listen for
notifications, an effect that might otherwise require explicitly setting up an
array.<p>
<p>
You instantiate a notification object directly by sending the
<b>notificationWithName:object:</b> or
<b>notificationWithName:object:userInfo:</b> messages to the NSNotification
class object. You can also create notifications indirectly through the
NSNotificationCenter class using the <b>postNotificationName:object:</b> and
<b>postNotificationName:object:userInfo:</b> convenience methods. <p>
<p>
You can subclass NSNotification to contain information in addition to the
notification name, sender, and dictionary.<p>
<p>
NSNotification objects are immutable objects.<p>
<p>
The NSNotification class adopts the NSCopying protocol, making it possible to
treat notifications as context-independent values that can be copied and
reused. You can put notifications in an array and send the <b>copy</b> message
to that array, which recursively copies every item. This essentially allows
clients to deal with notifications as first class values that can be copied by
collections.<p>

<b>Creating Notification Objects</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSNotification *)<b>notificationWithName:</b>(NSString *)<i>aName</i>
<i></i><b>object:</b>(id)<i>anObject</i>	Returns a notification object that
associates the name <i>aName</i> with the object <i>anObject</i>.
</LI><LI> +  (NSNotification *)<b>notificationWithName:</b>(NSString *)<i>aName</i>
<i></i><b>object:</b>(id)<i>anObject	</i>Returns a notification object that
associates the name
<b>userInfo:</b>(NSDictionary *)<i>userInfo</i>		<i>aName</i> with the object
<i>anObject</i> and the dictionary of arbitrary data <i>userInfo</i>.
<i>userInfo</i> may be <b>nil</b>.</LI></UL>
<b>Querying a Notification Object</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSString *)<b>name</b>	Returns the name of the notification.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>object</b>	Returns the object (such as the sender) that's associated
with this notification.
</LI><LI> -  (NSDictionary *)<b>userInfo</b>	Returns a dictionary object associated with
this notification. Returns <b>nil</b> if there is no such object.

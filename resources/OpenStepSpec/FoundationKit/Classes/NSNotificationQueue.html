<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSNotificationQueue objects (or simply, <i>notification queues</i>) act as
buffers for notifications centers (instances of NSNotificationCenter). A
notification queue maintains notifications (instances of NSNotification)
generally in a FIFO order (First In First Out). When a notification rises to
the top of the queue, the queue posts it to the
notification center, which in turn dispatches the notification to all objects
registered as observers. <p>
<p>
NSNotificationQueue contributes two important features to OpenStep's
notification mechanism: asynchronous posting and the coalescing of
notifications. With NSNotificationCenter's <b>postNotification:</b> and its
variants, you can post a notification immediately to a notification center.
However, the invocation of the method is synchronous: Before the posting object
can resume its thread of execution, it must wait until the notification center
dispatches the notification to all observers and returns. With
NSNotificationQueue's <b>enqueueNotification:postingStyle: </b>and<b>
enqueueNotification:postingStyle:coalesceMask:forModes</b>:, however, you can
post a notification asynchronously by putting it on the queue. These methods
immediately return to the invoking object after putting the notification in the
queue.<p>
<p>
Posting to a notification queue can occur in one of three different styles. The
posting style is an argument to both <b>enqueueNotification:...</b> methods:<p>
<p>
.	<b>NSPostWhenIdle</b>. The notification is posted when the run loop is
idle.<p>
<p>
.	<b>NSPostASAP</b>. The notification is posted as soon as possible.<p>
<p>
.	<b>NSPostNow</b>. The notification is posted immediately to the notification
center.<p>
<p>
<b>Note:  </b>See Enqueuing with the Different Posting
Styles, below, for details on and examples of enqueuing
notifications with the three <b>postingStyle:</b> constants.<p>
<p>
<p>
What is the difference between enqueuing notifications with <b>NSPostNow</b>
and posting notifications (<b>postNotification:</b>)? Both post notifications
immediately (but synchronously) to the notification center. The difference is
that <b>enqueueNotification:...</b> (with <b>NSPostNow</b> as posting style)
coalesces notifications in the queue before posting while
<b>postNotification:</b> does not.<p>
<p>
Coalescing is a process that removes notifications in the queue that are
similar to the notification just enqueued (or posted, if posting style is
<b>NSPostNow</b>. The notification queue scans the notifications in the queue
for those with attributes matching the new notification and removes them,
except for the notification that is topmost in the queue (closest to being
posted). You indicate the criteria for similarity by specifying the
NSNotificationCoalescing constants in the third argument of
<b>enqueueNotification:postingStyle:coalesceMask:forModes</b>: (OR them in if
multiple):<p>
<p>
.	<b>NSNotificationNoCoalescing</b>. Do not coalesce notifications in the
queue.<p>
<p>
.	<b>NSNotificationCoalescingOnName</b>. Coalesce notifications with the same
name.<p>
<p>
.	<b>NSNotificationCoalescingOnSender</b>. Coalesce notifications with the same
sender.<p>
<p>
Every task has a default notification queue, which is associated with the
task's default notification center. You can create your own notification
queues, and have multiple queues per center and task; but you can have only one
notification center per task. NSNotificationQueue is a public, concrete class;
instances of it are mutable.<p>
<p>

<b>Enqueuing with the Different Posting Styles</b><p>

Any notification enqueued with the <b>NSPostASAP</b> posting style is posted to
the notification center when the code executing in the current run loop callout
completes. Callouts can be Application Kit event messages, file descriptor
changes, timers, or another asynchronous notification. You'd typically use the
<b>NSPostASAP</b> posting style for an expensive resource, like the Display
PostScript server. When many clients draw on the window buffer during a
callout, it's expensive to flush the buffer to the Display PostScript server
after every draw operation. So in this case, each <b>draw...</b> method
enqueues some notification such as
FlushTheServer<b> </b>with coalescing on name
and sender specified, and a posting style of <b>NSPostASAP</b>. As a result,
only one of those notifications is dispatched at the end of the current
callout, and the window buffer is flushed only once. <p>
<p>
A notification enqueued with the <b>NSPostIdle</b> posting style is posted only
when the run loop is in a wait state. In this state, there is nothing in the
run loop's input channels, be it timers or other asynchronous notifications. A
typical example of enqueuing with the <b>NSPostIdle</b> posting style occurs
when the user types text, and the program displays the size of the text in
bytes somewhere. It would be very expensive (and not very useful) to update the
displayed size after each character the user types, especially if the user
types fast. In this case, the program enqueues a notification after each
character typed such as ChangeTheDisplayedSize
with coalescing turned on and a posting style of <b>NSPostWhenIdle</b>. When
the user stops typing, the single
ChangeTheDisplayedSize notification in the queue
(due to coalescing) is posted when the run loop is in a wait state and the
display is updated.<p>
<p>
A notification enqueued with <b>NSPostNow</b> is posted immediately to the
notification center. You enqueue a notification with <b>NSPostNow</b> (or post
one with NSNotificationCenter's <b>postNotification:</b>) when you do not
require asynchronous calling behavior. For many programming situations,
synchronous behavior is not only allowable but desirable; you want the
notification center to return after dispatching so you can be sure that
observing objects have received the notification. Of course, you should enqueue
with <b>NSPostNow</b> rather than use <b>postNotification:</b> when there are
similar notifications in the queue that you want to remove through
coalescing.<p>

<b>Creating Notification Queues</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSNotificationQueue *)<b>defaultQueue</b>	Returns the default
NSNotificationQueue object for the current task. This object always uses the
default notification-center object for the same task.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>init	</b>Initializes and returns an NSNotificationQueue object that
uses the default notification-center object.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>initWithNotificationCenter:</b>(NSNotificationCenter
*)<i>notificationCenter</i>
<i></i>	Initializes and returns an NSNotificationQueue object that uses the
notification-center object specified in <i>notificationCenter</i>.</LI></UL>
<b>Inserting and Removing Notifications From a Queue</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>dequeueNotificationsMatching:</b>(NSNotification
*)<i>notification</i>
<i></i><b>coalesceMask:</b>(unsigned int)<i>coalesceMask	</i>Removes all
notifications from the queue that match the <i>notification</i>'s attributes as
specified by <i>coalesceMask</i>. The mask (set through
NSNotificationCoalescing constants) can specify notification name, notification
sender, or both name and sender.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>enqueueNotification:</b>(NSNotification *)<i>notification</i>
<i></i><b>postingStyle:</b>(NSPostingStyle)<i>postingStyle	</i>Puts a
<i>notification</i> in the queue that the queue will post to the<i>
</i>notification center at the time indicated by <i>postingStyle. </i>The
notification queue posts in all runloop modes, and it coalesces only
notifications in the queue that match both the name and sender of
<i>notification</i>

<b>coalesceMask:</b>(unsigned int)<i>coalesceMask	</i>	the notification center
at the time indicated by
<b>forModes:</b>(NSArray *)<i>modes	</i>	<i>postingStyle,</i> but only if the
runloop is in a mode identified by one of the string objects in the
<i>modes</i> array. The notification queue coalesces related notifications in
the queue as specified by <i>coalesceMask</i>. If <i>modes</i> is <b>nil</b>,
all runloop modes are valid for posting.

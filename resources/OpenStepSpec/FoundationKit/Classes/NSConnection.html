<b>NSConnection </b><p>

<B>Inherits From: </B><A HREF="NSObject.html">NSObject</A><p>

<b>Conforms To:	</b>NSObject (NSObject)

<b>Declared In:	</b>Foundation/NSConnection.h <p>
<p>

<b>Class Description</b><p>


The NSConnection class declares the programmatic interface to objects that
manage a <i>connection</i> such that objects in one thread can send messages to
objects in another thread (typically, in another process, and it defines
instances that manage each side of such a connection. <p>
<p>
Each distinct thread of execution has one default connection defined. Any given
thread can have as many connections as desired, but a given connection can be
served by only one thread.<p>
<p>
To set up a connection, some object in your application must be established as
what is known as a root object and registered
with a name in the Network Name Server. Such root objects can then be connected
to by other threads, and can receive messages sent to them from other threads.
An easy way to establish an object as a root object is to send the
<b>defaultConnection</b> method to the NSConnection class object to obtain a
connection object. Then use <b>setRootObject: </b>to<b> </b>establish the
desired object as the object that will be registered, followed by
<b>registerName:</b> to make that object available to the Network Name Server
under the specified name.<p>
<p>
To obtain a connection to an object registered elsewhere, you will generally
send the<b> rootProxyForConnectionWithRegisteredName:host:</b> method to the
NSConnection class object. This method returns a proxy to the remote object.
You should then inform the proxy of the protocol(s) the remote object responds
to using <b>setProtocolForProxy:</b>. To obtain the actual connection object
instead of the proxy, use the <b>connectionWithRegisteredName:host:</b>
method.<p>
<p>
If the string <b>@"*"</b> is used where a hostname is required, it implies a
lookup for any server registered with the specified name on the local subnet.
If <b>nil</b> is supplied where a hostname is required, the name lookup occurs
only on the local host.<p>
<p>
When an NSConnection object is deallocated, the notification NSConnectionDeath
is posted to the default notification center with that NSConnection object.<p>
<p>

<b>Exceptions</b><p>


NSConnection can raise NSInternalInconsistencyException for a variety of
reasons when it detects impossible situations.
In addition, NSConnection can raise NSInvalidArgumentException when a remote
method invocation sends an unknown selector.<p>
<p>

<b>Initializing a Connection</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (id)<b>init</b>	Initialize a newly allocated NSConnection suitable for a new
registry and new name.</LI></UL>
<b>Establishing a Connection</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSConnection *)<b>connectionWithRegisteredName:</b>(NSString *)<i>name</i>

<b>host:</b>(NSString *)<i>hostName</i>	Registers and returns a connection with
<i>name</i> on <i>hostName</i>.
</LI><LI> +  (NSConnection *)<b>defaultConnection</b>	Establishes and returns a default
per-thread connection.
</LI><LI> +  (NSDistantObject *)<b>rootProxyForConnectionWithRegisteredName:</b>(NSString
*)<i>name</i> 
<b>host</b>:(NSString *)<i>hostName</i>	Registers a connection with <i>name</i>
on <i>hostName</i> and returns its root proxy.</LI></UL>
<b>Determining Connections</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSArray *)<b>allConnections</b>	Returns an array describing all existing
valid connections.
</LI><LI> -  (BOOL)<b>isValid</b>	Identifies that the receiver is a valid connection.</LI></UL>
<b>Registering a Connection</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (BOOL)<b>registerName:</b>(NSString *)<i>name</i>	Registers the connection
with <i>name</i> on the local system and returns YES if the registration was
successful, NO otherwise.</LI></UL>
<b>Assigning a Delegate</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (id)<b>delegate	</b>Returns the connection's delegate.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>setDelegate:</b>(id)<i>anObject</i>	Sets the connection's delegate.
</LI></UL>
<b>Getting and Setting the Root Object</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (id)<b>rootObject</b>	Returns the root object served.
</LI><LI> -  (NSDistantObject *)<b>rootProxy</b>	Returns an NSDistantObject proxy to the
root object served by this connection.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>setRootObject:</b>(id)<i>anObject</i>	Sets the root object being
served to <i>anObject</i>; if the root object already exists, replaces it with
<i>anObject</i>.  Be aware that if the root object is replaced while a
connection is active, existing root proxies on the client side of the
connection will continue to communicate with the previous root object, while
new proxies will communicate with the newly established root object. </LI></UL>
<b>Request Mode</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSString *)<b>requestMode</b>	Returns the mode in which requests are
honored.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>setRequestMode:</b>(NSString *)<i>mode</i>	Sets the mode in which
requests are honored to <i>mode</i>.</LI></UL>
<b>Conversation Queueing</b><p>


-(BOOL)<b>independentConversationQueueing</b>	Returns
<b>conversationQueuing</b> mode. The default value is NO.<p>
<p>
-(void)<b>setIndependentConversationQueueing:</b>(BOOL)<i>flag</i><p>
<i></i>	If <i>flag</i> is YES, unrelated requests are queued for later
processing. This allows a server to use distributed objects freely in its
implementation without concern for the consistency of its internal state. Note
that this can cause deadlocks among peers.<p>

<b>Timeouts</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSTimeInterval)<b>replyTimeout</b>	Returns the reply timeout time
interval.
</LI><LI> -  (NSTimeInterval)<b>requestTimeout</b>	Returns the request timeout time
interval.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>setReplyTimeout:</b>(NSTimeInterval)<i>interval	</i>Sets the reply
timeout to the time interval <i>interval</i>.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>setRequestTimeout:</b>(NSTimeInterval)<i>interval</i>	 Sets the
request timeout to the time interval <i>interval</i>.</LI></UL>
<b>Get Statistics</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSDictionary *)<b>statistics</b>	Returns statistics for this connection.</LI></UL>
<b>Implemented by the Delegate</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (BOOL)<b>makeNewConnection:</b>(NSConnection *)<i>connection</i>
<i></i><b>sender:</b>(NSConnection *)<i>ancestor</i>	Asks permission to create
a new connection <i>connection</i> where <i>ancestor</i> is the ancestral
connection; returns YES if connection allowed.

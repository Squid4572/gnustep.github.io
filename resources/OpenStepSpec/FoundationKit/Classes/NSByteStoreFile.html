<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSByteStoreFile is a subclass of NSByteStore that keeps its storage in a file.
NSByteStoreFile guarantees the integrity of stored data against process and
system crashes when protected by transactions (described in the NSByteStore
class specification), provided that the physical media remains intact. <p>
<p>
When you create an NSByteStoreFile, you specify a storage file and open it for
reading only or for both reading and writing. The methods you use to access the
contents of the file are implemented in NSByteStore. <p>
<p>
To support the use of preconfigured files, a process using an NSByteStoreFile
opened for reading only may freely modify the NSByteStoreFile; all modified
pages are reflected only in the address space of the process. The modifications
are never written to the file and are discarded when the NSByteStoreFile is
freed.<p>

<b>Creating and Initializing an NSByteStoreFile Instance </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSByteStore *)<b>byteStoreFile:</b>(NSString*)<i>path</i>	Creates and
initializes an NSByteStoreFile with <i>path</i> as its 
<b>transactionsEnabled:</b>(BOOL)<i>enable</i> 		storage file. If <i>enable</i>
is YES, transactions are enabled. 
<b>create:</b>(BOOL)<i>create 		</i>If <i>create</i> is YES, the file
<i>path</i> is created. If <i>readOnly</i> is 
<b>readOnly:</b>(BOOL)<i>readOnly		</i>YES, <i>path</i> is opened for reading.
If <i>readOnly</i> is NO, path is opened for reading and writing.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>initWithPath:</b>(NSString*)<i>path</i>	Initializes a newly allocated
NSByteStoreFile with <i>path</i> as 
<b>transactionsEnabled:</b>(BOOL)<i>enable</i> 		its storage file. If
<i>enable</i> is YES, transactions are 
<b>create:</b>(BOOL)<i>create 		</i>enabled. If <i>create</i> is YES, the file
<i>path</i> is created. If 
<b>readOnly:</b>(BOOL)<i>readOnly		readOnly</i> is YES, <i>path</i> is opened
for reading. If <i>readOnly</i> is NO, path is opened for reading and
writing.</LI></UL>
<b>Accessing the Storage File</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSString *)<b>storePath</b>	Returns the path of the storage file.</LI></UL>
<b>Reducing Memory Consumption</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>compactUntilDate:</b>(NSDate *)<i>limitDate</i>	Removes free space
by relocating blocks toward the origin of the virtual address space defined by
the NSByteStoreFile. <i>limitDate</i> sets a time limit on this operation. No
<i>limitDate</i> allows the compaction to run to completion.

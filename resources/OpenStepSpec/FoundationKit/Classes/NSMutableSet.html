<b>Class Description</b><p>


The NSMutableSet class declares the programmatic interface to an object that
manages a mutable set of objects. NSMutableSet provides support for the
mathematical concept of a <i>set</i>. A set, both in its mathematical sense,
and in the OpenStep implementation of NSMutableSet, is an <i>unordered</i>
collection of distinct elements. OpenStep also provides the NSCountedSet class
for a mutable set that can contain multiple instances of the same element, and
provides the NSSet class for creating and managing immutable sets. In general,
you should use NSSet unless you really need a mutable set.<p>
<p>
Use set objects as an alternative to array objects when the order of elements
is not important, but performance in testing whether an object is contained in
the set <i>is</i> a considerationwhile arrays are ordered, testing for
membership is slower than with sets.<p>
<p>
Objects in a set must respond to <b>hash</b> and <b>isEqual:</b> methods. See
the NSObject protocol for details on <b>hash</b> and <b>isEqual:</b>.<p>
<p>
Generally, you instantiate an NSMutableSet object by sending one of the
<b>set1/4</b> methods to the NSMutableSet class object, as described in the
method descriptions for NSSet. These methods return an NSMutableSet object
containing the elements (if any) you pass in as arguments. Newly created
instances of NSMutableSet created by invoking the <b>set</b> method can be
populated with objects using any of the <b>init1/4</b> methods.
<b>initWithObjects::</b> is the designated initializer for this class.<p>
<p>
Objects are added to an NSMutableSet using <b>addObject:</b>, which adds a
single specified object to the set,<b> addObjectsFromArray:</b>, which adds all
objects from a specified array to the set, or by<b> unionSet:</b>, which adds
all the objects from another set to this set.<p>
<p>
Objects are removed from an NSMutableSet using any of the methods<b>
intersectSet:</b>, <b>minusSet:</b>,<b> removeAllObjects</b>	, or
<b>removeObject:</b>.<p>
<p>

<b>Allocating and Initializing an NSMutableSet</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (id)<b>allocWithZone:</b>(NSZone *)<i>zone</i>	Creates and returns an
uninitialized set object in <i>zone.</i>
<i></i></LI><LI> +  (id)<b>setWithCapacity:</b>(unsigned)<i>numItems</i>	Creates and returns a
set object, giving it enough allocated memory to hold <i>numItems</i>
objects.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>initWithCapacity:</b>(unsigned)<i>numItems</i>	Initializes a newly
allocated set object, giving it enough allocated memory to hold <i>numItems</i>
objects.</LI></UL>
<b>Adding Objects	</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>addObject:</b>(id)<i>object</i>	Adds <i>object</i> to the set,
unless <i>object </i>is equal to some object already in the set.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>addObjectsFromArray:</b>(NSArray *)<i>array</i>	Adds to the set all
the objects in <i>array</i>, by calling <b>addObject:</b> for each one.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>unionSet:</b>(NSSet *)<i>other </i>	Adds to the receiving set all
the objects in <i>other</i>, by calling <b>addObject:</b> for each one.</LI></UL>
<b>Removing Objects</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>intersectSet:</b>(NSSet *)<i>other</i>	Removes from the receiving
set every object that's not equal to any object in <i>other</i>, by calling
<b>removeObject:</b> for each one.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>minusSet:</b>(NSSet *)<i>other</i>	Removes from the receiving set
every object that's equal to some object in <i>other</i>, by calling
<b>removeObject:</b> for each one.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>removeAllObjects</b>	Empties the set of all its elements. (This
method doesn't call<b> removeObject:</b>.)
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>removeObject:</b>(id)<i>object</i>	If any member of the receiving
set is equal to <i>object</i>, this method removes that object from the set.

<b>Class Description</b><p>


An NSThread object controls a thread of execution. You use an NSThread when you
want to terminate or delay a thread or you want a new thread. <p>
<p>
A <i>thread</i> is an executable unit. A <i>task</i> is made up of one or more
threads. Each thread has its own execution stack and is capable of independent
I/O. All threads share the virtual memory address space and communication
rights of their task. When a thread is started, it is <i>detached</i> from its
initiating thread. The new thread runs independently. That is, the initiating
thread does not know the new thread's state.<p>
<p>
To obtain an NSThread object that represents your current thread of execution,
use the <b>currentThread</b> method. To obtain an NSThread object that will
create a new thread of execution, use
<b>detachNewThreadSelector:toTarget:withObject:</b>. This method sends the
specified Objective C message to the specified object in its own thread of
execution. You use the NSThread object returned by these methods if you ever
need to delay or terminate that thread of execution.<p>
<p>
When you use <b>detachNewThreadSelector:toTarget:withObject:</b>, your
application becomes multithreaded. At any time, you can send
<b>isMultiThreaded</b> to find out if the application is multithreaded, that
is, if a thread was ever detached from the current thread.
<b>isMultiThreaded</b> returns YES even if the detached thread has completed
execution.<p>
<p>

<b>Creating an NSThread</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSThread *)<b>currentThread</b>	Returns an object representing the current
thread of execution.
</LI><LI> +  (void)<b>detachNewThreadSelector:</b>(SEL)<i>aSelector</i>	Creates and starts
a new NSThread for the message 
<b>toTarget:</b>(id)<i>aTarget</i>		<b>[aTarget aSelector:anArgument]</b>. The
method 
<b>withObject:</b>(id)<i>anArgument</i>		<i>aSelector</i> may take only one
argument and may not have a return value. If this is the first thread detached
from the current thread, this method posts the notification
NSBecomingMultiThreaded will the nil object to the default notification center.
</LI></UL>
<b>Querying a Thread </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (BOOL)<b>isMultiThreaded</b>	Returns YES if a thread was ever detached
(regardless of if the detached thread is still running).
</LI><LI> -  (NSMutableDictionary *)<b>threadDictionary</b>	Returns the NSThread's
dictionary, allowing you to add data specific to the receiving NSThread. This
essentially allows user-defined NSThread variables.</LI></UL>
<b>Delaying a Thread</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (void)<b>sleepUntilDate:</b>(NSDate *)<i>date</i>	Has the receiving NSThread
sleep until the time specified by <i>date</i>. No input or timers will be
processed in this interval.</LI></UL>
<b>Terminating a Thread </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (void)<b>exit</b>	Terminates the thread represented by the calling object.
Before exiting that thread, this method posts the NSThreadExiting notification
with the thread being exited to the default notification center.

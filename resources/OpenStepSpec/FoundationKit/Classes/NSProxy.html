<b>NSProxy </b><p>

<B>Inherits From: </B>none(<i>NXProxy is a root class</i>) <p>
<p>
<b>Conforms To:	</b>NSObject 
<p>
<b>Declared In:	</b>Foundation/NSProxy <p>
<p>

<b>Class Description</b><p>


The NSProxy class declares the programmatic interface to
<i>proxies</i>objects that stand in for real objects (usually
descendants of the NSObject class), where the real objects may exist within the
same or another process, perhaps even in a system of a different architecture
across a network. To the application, the proxy behaves like the real object,
though the real object may not be directly accessible, and in general, instance
variables of remote objects are not accessible.<p>
<p>
NSProxy class defines few methods, because proxies respond to few messages
directly. Instead, when a proxy receives a message it doesn't respond to, it
encodes the message, including the arguments, in an invocation, and invokes
<b>forwardInvocation:</b>. Specialized subclasses then direct further
processing, such as forwarding the message to a real object in the same or
another process.<p>
<p>
Methods defined in this class are methods that the NSProxy class responds to
directly. Unless otherwise noted, none of these methods are forwarded to the
proxy's correspondent.<p>
<p>
Your application in general doesn't instantiate NSProxy objectsthey're
created as instances of specialized subclasses. Proxies are reference-counted
so that only a single NSProxy per connection is instantiated for any real
object.<p>

<b>Creating and Destroying Instances	</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (id)<b>alloc</b>	Returns a new, uninitialized instance of the receiving
class.
</LI><LI> +  (id)<b>allocWithZone:</b>(NSZone *)<i>zone</i>	Returns a new, uninitialized
instance of the receiving class in <i>zone</i>.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>dealloc</b>	Deallocates the memory occupied by the receiver. </LI></UL>
<b>Identifying Classes	</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (Class)<b>class</b>	Returns <b>self</b>. Since this is a class method, it
returns the class object.</LI></UL>
<b>Obtaining Method Information</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSMethodSignature
*)<b>methodSignatureForSelector:</b>(SEL)<i>aSelector</i>
<i></i>	Implemented by subclasses to return an object that contains a
description of the <i>aSelector</i> method, or <b>nil</b> if the
<i>aSelector</i> method can't be found. The NSProxy implementation of this
method raises an NSInvalidArgumentException exception.</LI></UL>
<b>Describing Objects</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSString *)<b>description</b>	Prints the name of receiver's class and the
hexadecimal value of the its <b>id</b>.</LI></UL>
<b>Forwarding Messages</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>forwardInvocation:</b>(NSInvocation *)<i>invocation</i>
<i></i>	Implemented by subclasses to forward messages to other objects. The
NSProxy implementation of this method raises an NSInvalidArgumentException
exception.

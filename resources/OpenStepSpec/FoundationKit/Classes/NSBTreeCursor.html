<b>Class Description</b><p>


An NSBTreeCursor provides access to the keys and values stored in an
NSBTreeBlock. It's essentially a pointer into the NSBTreeBlock's key space, and
may be positioned by key to perform operations on the value stored at a given
location. <p>
<p>
An NSBTreeCursor works with a single NSBTreeBlock, but several NSBTreeCursors
may access the same NSBTreeBlock and be positioned independently without
conflict. See the NSBTreeBlock class specification for more information on
concurrent access with multiple NSBTreeCursors.<p>
<p>

<b>Positioning the Cursor and Accessing Data</b><p>

NSBTreeCursor contains methods that walk through the key/value pairs in the
NSBTreeBlock. The method <b>moveCursorToFirstKey</b> will point the cursor to
the first key in the key space, and you can use <b>moveCursorToNextKey</b> to
essentially walk through all of the keys in the NSBTreeBlock. To point the
cursor at a specific key/value pair, use <b>moveCursorToKey:</b>. This method
returns YES if it finds the key and NO if it does not. If
<b>moveCursorToKey:</b> returns NO, it still points the cursor at that key. For
example, suppose the keys into the key space are integer IDs divisible by 10,
and you call <b>moveCursorToKey:</b> with 54 as the key. (In reality, keys must
be NSData objects, but to make this example more clear, it uses integers.)
There is no key 54, so <b>moveCursorToKey:</b> returns NO, but the cursor
points to where key 54 would be if it existed. A subsequent call to
<b>moveCursorToNextKey</b> would point the cursor at key 60. The method
<b>isOnKey</b> tells you if the cursor is pointing to a valid key.<p>
<p>
To insert a key/value pair into the NSBTreeBlock, you take advantage of the
<b>moveCursorToKey:</b> method's return value. Send <b>moveCursorToKey:</b>
with the key you want to insert. If if returns NO, send <b>writeValue:</b> with
the value you want to insert. The key/value pair will be inserted.<p>
<p>
A cursor at a position with no key can't access a value there. If the cursor is
asked to access a value anyway, it has two options: try to find a value or
indicate that it can't access one. Where it makes sense, a cursor should try to
find a value by sliding forward in the key space to the next actual key. When
this isn't possible or desirable, the cursor should indicate that it can't find
or access a value, by raising the NSBTreeNoValueException exception. In the
previous example, if the cursor is asked to retrieve the information at key 54,
the cursor will slide forward and return the information at key 60. At this
point, you can use the <b>cursorKey</b> method to find out which key the cursor
is pointing to. <b>cursorKey</b> will return 60 to let you know that the cursor
has slid forward.<p>
<p>
A cursor cannot write inside (with the method <b>writeValue:range:</b>) or
remove the value (with the method <b>removeValue</b>) at a location where there
is no key. Since there is no value, and since writing into part of a value or
removing it would change data that the programmer probably doesn't want altered
(namely, the value for the next actual key), the NSBTreeCursor will indicate
that there is no value to write into by raising the NSBTreeNoValueException
exception.<p>
<p>

<b>Working With the NSByteStore</b><p>

Since NSBTreeBlock is an NSByteStore client, the transaction model of
NSByteStore applies to changes made to the contents of an NSBTreeBlock. In
particular, you must send the <b>commitTransaction</b> message to the
NSByteStore to have changes to the NSBTreeBlock take effect (and be flushed to
disk for a file-based store). If an NSBTreeBlock is used on a strictly
read-only basis, transaction management can be ignored. <p>
<p>
After an <b>abortTransaction</b>, a cursor may be pointing to a key that no
longer exists. Therefore, you must reposition each cursor using one of the
<b>moveCursor...</b> methods after an <b>abortTransaction</b>.<p>

<b>Creating and Initializing a New NSBTreeCursor Instance </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSBTreeCursor *)<b>bTreeCursorWithBTree:</b>(NSBTreeBlock *)<i>aBTre</i>e
	Returns a new NSBTreeCursor instance and associates it with the <i>aBTree</i>
object.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>initWithBTree:</b>(NSBTreeBlock *)<i>aBTree</i>	Initializes a newly
allocated NSBTreeCursor instance and associates it with the <i>aBTree</i>
object.</LI></UL>
<b>Obtaining Information about the NSBTreeBlock</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSBTreeBlock *)<b>btree</b>	Returns the NSBTreeBlock with which the
NSBTreeCursor is associated.</LI></UL>
<b>Positioning the Cursor</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (BOOL)<b>moveCursorToFirstKey</b>	Positions the cursor at the first key in
the key space.
</LI><LI> -  (BOOL)<b>moveCursorToLastKey</b>	Positions the cursor at the last key in the
key space.
</LI><LI> -  (BOOL)<b>moveCursorToNextKey</b>	Positions the cursor at the next key in the
key space. If the cursor is at the last key, it does not move.
</LI><LI> -  (BOOL)<b>moveCursorToPreviousKey</b>	Positions the cursor at the previous key
in the key space. If the cursor is at the first key, it does not move.
</LI><LI> -  (BOOL)<b>moveCursorToKey:</b>(NSData *)<i>key</i>	Positions the cursor at
<i>key</i>. 
</LI><LI> - (BOOL)<b>isOnKey</b>	Returns YES if the cursor matched a key on the last
operation.</LI></UL>
<b>Accessing the Data</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSData *)<b>cursorKey</b>	Returns the key that the cursor is pointing to.
</LI><LI> -  (NSData *)<b>cursorValue</b>	Returns the value associated with the key that
the cursor is pointing to.
</LI><LI> -  (NSData *)<b>cursorValueWithRange:</b>(NSRange)<i>range</i>
<i></i>	Returns a portion, specified by <i>range</i>, of the value associated
with the key that the cursor is pointing to.</LI></UL>
<b>Changing the Data in the NSBTreeBlock</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (BOOL)<b>writeValue:</b>(NSData *)<i>value</i>	Replaces the value associated
with the key that the cursor is pointing to, if the key exists. If the key does
not exist, it creates a new key/value pair using the key that the cursor is
currently pointing to and <i>value</i> as the value. This method returns YES if
it inserted a new key/value pair and NO if it overwrote an existing value.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>writeValue:</b>(NSData *)<i>value</i> 	Replaces a portion, starting
at <i>index</i>, of the value associated 
<b>atIndex:</b>(unsigned)<i>index		</i>with the key that the cursor is pointing
to. If the key does not exist, the NSBTreeNoValueException exception is
raised.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>removeValue</b>	Deletes the key/value pair from the NSBTreeBlock. If
the key/value pair already does not exist, the NSBTreeNoValueException
exception is raised.

<b>Class Description</b><p>


The NSCharacterSet class declares the programmatic interface to objects that
construct immutable <i>descriptions</i> of character sets in the Unicode
character encoding. Using NSCharacterSet objects, you can determine if a given
Unicode character belongs to a specified set. See NSMutableCharacterSet for a
class that constructs descriptions of character sets that can be modified
dynamically. NSCharacterSet's primitive methods are <b>characterIsMember:</b>
and <b>bitmapRepresentation</b>. Subclasses of NSCharacterSet must implement
these two methods.<p>
<p>
NSCharacterSet objects can be thought of as loosely analogous to the
<b>is1/4</b> macros (such as <b>isupper()</b>)available in the <b>ctype</b>
collection of most standard C libraries. NSCharacterSet objects, however, offer
much greater flexibility in that you can dynamically construct your own custom
character sets against which you can test characters.<p>
<p>
The term bitmap in the descriptions below does
not refer to bitmap characters in the sense of
screen fonts for display. The bitmaps referred
to here are compact ordered <i>bit set</i> representations of Unicode character
positions or ranges of Unicode characters.<p>
<p>
You create standard character setssuch as
a set of alphanumerics, or a set of decimal digitsby invoking the
NSCharacterSet class object with one of the methods described in
Creating a Standard Character Set. These methods
provide convenient means to create a standard set without needing to specify
the character positons explicitly.<p>
<p>
You can also create your own custom character
sets by using one of the methods described under Creating a
Custom Character Set. To create a character set with multiple
disjoint ranges, see the <b>add</b>1/4 methods described in
NSMutableCharacterSet.<p>

<b>Creating a Standard Character Set </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSCharacterSet *)<b>alphanumericCharacterSet</b>	Returns a character set
containing the uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z, other
alphabetic characters such as [[Yacute]], &#137;, &Ucirc;, &#135;, and so on)
and the decimal digit characters (0-9).
</LI><LI> +  (NSCharacterSet *)<b>controlCharacterSet</b>	Returns a character set
containing the control characters (characters with decimal Unicode values 0 to
31 and 127 to 159).
</LI><LI> +  (NSCharacterSet *)<b>decimalDigitCharacterSet</b>	Returns a character set
containing only decimal digit characters (0-9).
</LI><LI> +  (NSCharacterSet *)<b>decomposableCharacterSet</b>	Returns a character set
containing all individual Unicode characters that can also be represented as
composed character sequences.
</LI><LI> +  (NSCharacterSet *)<b>illegalCharacterSet</b>	Returns a character set
containing the illegal Unicode values.
</LI><LI> +  (NSCharacterSet *)<b>letterCharacterSet</b>	Returns a character set
containing the uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z, other
alphabetic characters such as [[Yacute]], &#137;, &Ucirc;, &#135;, and so
on).
</LI><LI> +  (NSCharacterSet *)<b>lowercaseLetterCharacterSet</b>
<b></b>	Returns a character set containing only lowercase alphabetic characters
(a-z, other alphabetic characters such as [[Yacute]], &Ucirc;, and so on).
</LI><LI> +  (NSCharacterSet *)<b>nonBaseCharacterSet</b>	Returns a set containing all
characters which are not defined to be base characters for purposes of dynamic
character composition.
</LI><LI> +  (NSCharacterSet *)<b>uppercaseLetterCharacterSet</b>
<b></b>	Returns a character set containing only uppercase alphabetic characters
(A-Z, other alphabetic characters such as &#137;, &#135;, and so on).
</LI><LI> +  (NSCharacterSet *)<b>whitespaceAndNewlineCharacterSet</b>
<b></b>	Returns a character set containing only whitespace characters (space
and tab) and the newline character.
</LI><LI> +  (NSCharacterSet *)<b>whitespaceCharacterSet</b>	Returns a character set
containing only in-line whitespace characters (space and tab). This set doesn't
contain the newline or carriage return characters.</LI></UL>
<b>Creating a Custom Character Set </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSCharacterSet *)<b>characterSetWithBitmapRepresentation:</b>(NSData
*)<i>data</i>	
	Returns a character set containing characters determined by the bitmap
representation <i>data</i>.
</LI><LI> +  (NSCharacterSet *)<b>characterSetWithCharactersInString:</b>(NSString
*)<i>aString</i>
<i></i>	Returns a character set containing the characters in <i>aString</i>. If
<i>aString</i> is empty, an empty character set is returned. <i>aString</i>
must not be <b>nil</b>.
</LI><LI> +  (NSCharacterSet *)<b>characterSetWithRange:</b>(NSRange)<i>aRange</i>
<i></i>	Returns a character set containing characters whose Unicode values are
given by <i>aRange</i>.</LI></UL>
<b>Getting a Binary Representation </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSData *)<b>bitmapRepresentation</b>	Returns an NSData object encoding the
receiving character set in binary format. This format is suitable for saving to
a file or otherwise transmitting or archiving.</LI></UL>
<b>Testing Set Membership </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (BOOL)<b>characterIsMember:</b>(unichar)<i>aCharacter</i>	Returns YES if
<i>aCharacter</i> is in the receiving character set, NO if it isn't.</LI></UL>
<b>Inverting a Character Set </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSCharacterSet *)<b>invertedSet</b>	Returns a character set containing only
characters that <i>don't</i> exist in the receiver.

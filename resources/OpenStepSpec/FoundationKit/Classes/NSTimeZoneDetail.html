<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSTimeZoneDetail is an abstract class that refines the behavior provided by
NSTimeZone. NSTimeZone identifies a geopolitical area with a name (such as
US/Pacific). NSTimeZoneDetail augments this region name with more specific
information appropriate for a particular date within its geopolitical region:
an abbreviation, an offset (in seconds) from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), and an
indication of whether Daylight Savings Time is in effect. The specificity
afforded through NSTimeZoneDetail helps to resolve conflicts between
abbreviations and offsets that can arise within regions.<p>
<p>
Even though it is a concrete subclass of NSTimeZone, NSTimeZoneDetail does
<i>not</i> have factory class methods that
create and return time-zone objects. See the specification of NSTimeZone for
methods that provide this ability.<p>
<p>
However, NSTimeZoneDetail does have methods that allow you to get the
abbreviation and temporal offset of a time-zone object, as well as determine
whether Daylight Savings Time is in effect.<p>
<p>

<b>Querying an NSTimeZoneDetail</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (BOOL)<b>isDaylightSavingTimeZone</b>	Returns YES if the time-zone detail
object is used in the representation of dates during Daylight Savings Time and
returns NO otherwise.
</LI><LI> -  (NSString *)<b>timeZoneAbbreviation</b>	Returns the abbreviation of the
time-zone detail object, such as EDT (Eastern Daylight Time).
</LI><LI> -  (int)<b>timeZoneSecondsFromGMT</b>	Returns the difference in seconds between
the receiving time-zone detail object and Greenwich Mean Time. The offset can
be a positive or negative value.

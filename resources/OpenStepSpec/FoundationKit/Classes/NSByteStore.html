<b>Class Description</b><p>


An NSByteStore object manages a single memory-based heap. Use NSByteStore to
allocate storage in data-intensive applications. Its main feature is
transaction management, which makes compound operations atomic and ensures data
integrity.<p>
<p>
You address the blocks of storage that an NSByteStore manages through unsigned
integers called block numbers. To gain access to the contents of a block, you
first must open the block for reading or writing. When you open a block, the
NSByteStore resolves the block number into a pointer. While a block is open,
you can address its contents using the pointer and can safely assume that the
block won't move. Once you close the block, however, the NSByteStore is free to
move it in order to compact storage; so the pointer may become invalid. <p>
<p>
The contents of an NSByteStore are relocatable to and from other instances of
NSByteStore and its subclasses. Although the address of a block becomes invalid
when the block is relocated, its block number remains constant. Since block
numbers are indirect references to data, it's possible to retrieve the contents
of an NSByteStore without invalidating block number-based referential data
structures residing in the NSByteStore, like linked lists or trees. This makes
it easy to copy complex structures or to quickly save them to a file.<p>
<p>
A subclass of NSByteStore, NSByteStoreFile, stores data in a file so that you
can retain data created and changed by your application. For more information,
see its class description. <p>
<p>

<b>Transactions</b><p>

NSByteStore implements <i>transactions</i>, allowing several operations to be
grouped together in such a way that either all of them take effect, or none of
them do. Transactions help to ensure semantic integrity by making compound
operations atomic, and they provide a convenient way to undo a series of
changes. If you use NSByteStoreFile, the use of transactions also ensures data
integrity against process and system crashes. This means that if a system loses
power, the NSByteStoreFile's contents can be recovered intact on power up, in
the state they were in after the last transaction that actually finished. <p>
<p>
Transactions are either enabled or disabled for an object. Most likely, you
will want to disable transactions for NSByteStores (unless you want the undo
capability) and enable them for NSByteStoreFiles. When transactions are
enabled, NSByteStore copies blocks that your application opens for writing.
Thus, updates are slower when transactions are enabled. If you are using
NSByteStore directly, its contents are always destroyed by a system crash, so
the only advantage to using transactions is the undo capability. If you are
using NSByteStoreFile, enabling transactions may save some of the changes made
before a system crash. Therefore, you should always use transactions with
NSByteStoreFile except if it contains data that can be easily reconstructed,
such as an index.<p>
<p>

<b>Using Transactions</b><p>

A single transaction begins with a <b>startTransaction</b> message and ends
with either a <b>commitTransaction</b> or <b>abortTransaction</b> message.
<b>startTransaction</b> enables transactions if they are disabled. Sending
<b>commitTransaction</b> means you want the changes made by this transaction to
take effect. <b>abortTransaction</b> means you want to cancel the changes made
by this transaction.<p>
<p>
You can check whether transactions have been enabled with
<b>areTransactionsEnabled</b>. You may want to do this if your code is invoked
by higher level methods that determine the transaction management policy for
the application. For example, NSByteStore uses <b>areTransactionsEnabled</b> to
determine whether or not to invoke <b>startTransaction</b> before responding to
an <b>empty</b> message.<p>
<p>
You can nest transactions. The first <b>startTransaction</b> message (or the
first message that opens a block after <b>enableTransactions</b>) starts
transaction 1. If you send <b>startTransaction</b> again before ending
transaction 1, it begins transaction 2, which is nested inside transaction 1.
The <b>nestingLevel</b> method returns the current nesting level of
transactions. <b>startTransaction</b> also returns the nesting level as the
transaction's ID. <p>
<p>
The trick with nesting transactions is: <i>the changes a transaction makes
aren't really made until the nesting level returns to 0</i>. In other words,
changes don't actually take effect until the top-level transaction is
committed. This means that any blocks that any of the transactions have opened
for writing will not be available until the all of the transactions are
finished. So, if you start a transaction at nesting level 2, make some changes
to blocks 3, 5, and 7, and then you send <b>commitTransaction</b>, all that
<b>commitTransaction</b> really does is set the nesting level to 1 and tell
transaction 1 about the changes to blocks 3, 5, and 7. If you then send
<b>commitTransaction</b> at transaction 1, <b>commitTransaction</b> sets the
nesting level to 0. Because the nesting level is now 0, the changes can take
place. Blocks 3, 5, and 7 are overwritten with the changes made during
transaction 2 and are made available. If instead you decide to abort
transaction 1 (by sending <b>abortTransaction</b>), the changes transaction 2
made to blocks 3, 5, and 7 are cancelled, as well as any changes transaction 1
made to any blocks. In this way, the parent of a transaction can undo changes
made by their children, but the children cannot undo the changes made by their
parents.<p>
<p>
Note that if your code makes changes outside any transaction while transactions
are enabled, an enclosing transaction is started automatically. The next
invocation of <b>startTransaction</b>, if any, before an intervening abort or
commit, simply picks up this enclosing transaction and reports a nesting level
of 1. Thus, if nesting isn't needed, your code can simply enable transactions
initially with a pair of <b>startTransaction</b>/<b>commitTransaction</b>
messages, and thereafter use only <b>commitTransaction</b> to mark transaction
boundaries. New transactions implicitly begin with the first modification
following each commit.<p>
<p>
Any modifications that haven't been committed are aborted when an NSByteStore
is freed.<p>
<p>

<b>Opening Blocks for Reading or Writing</b><p>

When you open a block for reading or writing, that block is unavailable until
you specify that you are finished. <p>
<p>
When you are finished reading a block, you send <b>closeBlock:</b>. Any method
that accesses information about a block opens it for reading. This means not
only does <b>readBlock:range:</b> open a block for reading, but so does
<b>sizeOfBlock:</b>, which returns the block's size. The <b>copyBlock:</b>
method opens the block for reading, but it also closes it when finished (unless
you already had that block opened for reading). Even if you commit a
transaction before you send <b>closeBlock:</b>, the block remains open for
reading.<p>
<p>
Any method that changes a block's contents opens the block for writing. This
means not only does <b>openBlock:range:</b> open a block for writing, but so do
the methods <b>copyBytes:toBlock:range:</b>, <b>createBlockOfSize:</b>, and
<b>freeBlock:</b>. You indicate that you are finished with a block you have
open for writing by having its changes take effect. Closing the block with
<b>closeBlock:</b> does <i>not</i> make your changes take effect, <i>even if
transactions are disabled</i>. Regardless of whether transactions are enabled
or disabled, you must send <b>commitTransaction</b> to have your changes
actually be made. <p>
<p>
If transactions are disabled, <b>commitTransaction</b> commits all the changes
made to blocks since that last <b>commitTransaction</b> or
<b>abortTransaction</b> message was sent. <b>abortTransaction</b> cancels all
the changes made since the last <b>commitTransaction</b>.<p>
<p>

<b>Creating an NSByteStore</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSByteStore *)<b>byteStore</b>	Returns a new NSByteStore with transactions
disabled.</LI></UL>
<b>Managing the NSByteStore</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (unsigned)<b>count</b>	Returns the number of blocks in the NSByteStore at
transaction level 0. That is, if you have created or freed some blocks but
those changes have not been committed at transaction level 0, <b>count</b> will
not reflect those changes.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>empty</b>	Frees all blocks of memory in the NSByteStore. If
transactions are enabled, this method starts and commits a new transaction. 
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>getBlocks:</b>(unsigned *)<i>blocks</i>	Returns in <i>blocks</i> a
C-style array of block numbers at transaction level 0. The caller must free the
returned array.
</LI><LI> -  (unsigned)<b>rootBlock</b>	Returns the number of the root block, which by
convention is used as a table of contents or a directory. </LI></UL>
<b>Creating, Copying, and Freeing Blocks</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (unsigned)<b>createBlockOfSize:</b>(unsigned)<i>size</i> 	Returns a block
number for a new block of <i>size</i> bytes with the contents initialized to
zero. Creating a block with size 0 is allowed. 
</LI><LI> -  (unsigned)<b>copyBlock:</b>(unsigned)<i>aBlock</i> 	Returns a block number
for a new block whose size and

<i>aBlock</i>.</LI></UL>
<b>Managing Block Sizes</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>resizeBlock:</b>(unsigned)<i>aBlock</i> 	Resizes the block
<i>aBlock</i> to <i>size</i> bytes. This 
<b>toSize:</b>(unsigned)<i>size</i>		method may change the location of the
block as well.
</LI><LI> -  (unsigned)<b>sizeOfBlock:</b>(unsigned)<i>aBlock</i>	Returns the size in
bytes of the block <i>aBlock</i>.</LI></UL>
<b>Using Transactions</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (unsigned)<b>startTransaction</b>	Begins a new transaction, enabling
transactions if necessary, for the current context. This transaction will be
aborted or committed before all other outstanding transactions. Returns a
number that both identifies the new transaction and indicates the number of
transactions outstanding.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>abortTransaction</b>	Reverts the NSByteStore to the state it was in
before the last <b>startTransaction</b> message or the last

available to other store contexts.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>commitTransaction</b>	Commits all changes made to blocks opened
since the last <b>startTransaction</b> or the last <b>commitTransaction</b> and
closes those blocks. If transactions are disabled or the nesting level becomes
0, this method makes all of the changed blocks available to other contexts. 
</LI><LI> -  (BOOL)<b>areTransactionsEnabled</b>	Returns YES if transactions are enabled
for the NSByteStore, NO if not. Transactions are enabled by the method
<b>startTransaction</b>.

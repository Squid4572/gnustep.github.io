<b>Class Description</b><p>


The NSCountedSet class declares the programmatic interface to an object that
manages a mutable set of objects. NSCountedSet provides support for the
mathematical concept of a <i>counted set</i>. A counted set, both in its
mathematical sense and in the OpenStep implementation of NSCountedSet, is an
unordered collection of elements, just as in a regular set, but the elements of
the set aren't necessarily distinct. In the literature, a counted set is also
knownas a <i>bag</i>.<p>
<p>
Each newthat is, distinctobject inserted into an NSCountedSet
object has a counter associated with it. NSCountedSet keeps track of the number
of times objects are inserted and requires that objects are removed the same
number of times. OpenStep also provides the NSSet class for sets whose elements
<i>are</i> distinctthat is, there is only one instance of an object in
an NSSet even if the object has been added to the set multiple times.<p>
<p>
Use set objects as an alternative to array objects when the order of elements
is not important, but performance in testing whether an object is contained in
the set <i>is</i> a considerationwhile arrays are ordered, testing for
membership is slower than with sets.<p>
<p>
Objects in a set must respond to <b>hash</b> and <b>isEqual:</b> methods. See
the NSObject protocol for details on <b>hash</b> and <b>isEqual:</b>. Each new
distinct object must provide a unique hash value.<p>
<p>
Generally, you instantiate an NSCountedSet object by sending one of the
<b>set1/4</b> methods to the NSCountedSet class object, as described in NSSet.
These methods return an NSCountedSet object containing the elements (if any)
you pass in as arguments. Newly created instances of NSCountedSet created by
invoking the <b>set</b> method can be populated with objects using any of the
<b>init1/4</b> methods. <b>initWithObjects::</b> is the designated initializer
for this class.<p>
<p>
You add or remove objects from a counted set using the <b>addObject:</b> and
<b>removeObject:</b> methods.<p>
<p>
An NSCountedSet may be queried using the <b>objectEnumerator</b> method, which
provides for traversing elements of the set one by one. The <b>countForObject:
</b>method returns the number of times the specified object has been added to
this set<b>.</b><p>


Initializing an NSCountedSet<p>
<p>
<p>
- (id)<b>initWithArray:</b>(NSArray *)<i>anArray</i>	Initializes a newly
allocated set object by placing in it the objects contained in
<i>anArray.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
- (id)<b>initWithCapacity:</b>(unsigned int)<i>numItems</i>	Initializes a newly
allocated set object, giving it enough memory to hold <i>numItems</i>
objects.<p>
<p>
- (id)<b>initWithSet:</b>(NSSet *)<i>anotherSet</i>	Initializes a newly
allocated set object by placing in it the objects contained in
<i>anotherSet.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Adding Objects	<p>
<p>
<p>
- (void)<b>addObject:</b>(id)<i>anObject</i>	Adds <i>anObject</i> to the set,
unless <i>anObject </i>is equal to some object already in the set. In either
case, the counter that's returned by <b>countForObject:</b> is incremented.<p>

<b>Removing Objects</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>removeObject:</b>(id)<i>anObject</i>	Decrements the counter for the
object, if the set contains an object that's equal to <i>anObject</i>. If this
causes the counter to reach zero, the object that's equal to <i>anObject</i> is
removed from the set.</LI></UL>
<b>Querying the NSCountedSet</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (unsigned int)<b>countForObject:</b>(id)<i>anObject</i>	Returns the number of
times that an object equal to <i>anObject</i> has ostensibly been added to the
set. (This number is incremented by <b>addObject: </b>and decremented by
<b>removeObject:</b>.)
</LI><LI> -  (NSEnumerator *)<b>objectEnumerator</b>	Returns an enumerator object that
will access each object in the set only once, regardless of its count.

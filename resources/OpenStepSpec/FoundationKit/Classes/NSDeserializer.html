<b>Class Description</b><p>


The NSDeserializer class declares methods that convert an abstract
representation of a property list (as contained in an NSData object) into a
graph of property list objects in memory. The NSDeserializer class object
itself provides these methods; you don't create instances of NSDeserializer.<p>
<p>
Options to these methods allow you to specify that container objects (arrays or
dictionaries) in the resulting graph be mutable or immutable; that
deserialization begin at the start of the data or from some position within it;
or that deserialization occur lazily, so that a property list is deserialized
only if it is actually going to be accessed. See the NSSerializer specification
for more information on serialization.<p>

<b>Deserialization Into Property Lists </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (id)<b>deserializePropertyListFromData:</b>(NSData *)<i>data</i>
<i></i>atCursor:(unsigned int*)<i>cursor</i>	Returns a property list object
corresponding to the abstract
<b>mutableContainers:</b>(BOOL)<i>mutable</i>		representation<i> </i>in
<i>data</i> at the location <i>cursor</i>. If <i>mutable</i> is YES and the
object is a dictionary or an array, the re-composed object is made mutable.
Returns <b>nil</b> if the object is not a valid one for property lists.
</LI><LI> +  (id)<b>deserializePropertyListFromData:</b>(NSData *)<i>data</i>
<i></i>mutableContainers:(BOOL)<i>mutable</i>	Returns a property list object
corresponding to the abstract representation<i> </i>in <i>data</i>. If
<i>mutable</i> is YES and the object is a dictionary or an array, the
re-composed object is made mutable. Returns <b>nil</b> if the data doesn't
represent a property list.
</LI><LI> +  (id)<b>deserializePropertyListLazilyFromData:</b>(NSData *)<i>data</i>
<b>atCursor:</b>(unsigned int*)<i>cursor</i>	Returns a property list from
<i>data</i> at location <i>cursor</i>. 
<b>length:</b>(unsigned int)<i>length</i>		The deserialization proceeds lazily.
That is, if the data 
<b>mutableContainers:</b>(BOOL)<i>mutable</i>		at the specified location has a
length greater than <i>length</i>, a proxy is substituted for the actual
property list as long as the constituent objects of that property list are not
being accessed. If <i>mutable</i> is YES and the object is a dictionary or an
array, the re-composed object is made mutable. Returns <b>nil</b> if the data
doesn't represent a property list.

<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSArchiver, a concrete subclass of NSCoder, defines an object that encodes
Objective C objects into an architecture-independent format that can be stored
in a file. When objects are archived, their class information and the values of
their instance variables are written to the archive. NSArchiver's companion
class, NSUnarchiver, takes an archive file and decodes its contents into a set
of objects equivalent to the original one.<p>
<p>
Archiving is typically initiated by sending an NSArchiver an
<b>encodeRootObject:</b> or <b>archiveRootObject:toFile:</b> message. These
messages specify a single object that is the starting point for archiving. The
root object receives an <b>encodeWithCoder:</b> message (see the NSCoding
protocol) that allows it to begin archiving itself and the other objects that
it's connected to. An object responds to an <b>encodeWithCoder:</b> message by
writing its instance variables to the archiver.<p>
<p>
An object doesn't have to archive the values of each of its instance variables.
Some values may not be important to reestablish and others may be derivable
from related state upon unarchiving. Other instance variables should be written
to the archive only under certain conditions, as explained below.<p>
<p>
NSArchiver overrides the inherited <b>encodeRootObject:</b> and
<b>encodeConditionalObject:</b> methods to support the conditional archiving of
members of a graph of objects. When an object receives an
<b>encodeWithCoder:</b> message, it should respond by unconditionally archiving
instance variables that are intrinsic to its nature (with the exceptions noted
above) and conditionally archiving those that are not.   For example, an NSView
unconditionally archives its array of subviews (using <b>encodeObject:</b>, or
the like) but conditionally archives its superview (using
<b>encodeConditionalObject:</b>). The archiving system notes each reference to
a conditional object, but doesn't actually archive the object unless some other
object in the graph requests the object to be archived unconditionally. This
ensures that an object is only archived once despite multiple references to it
in the object graph. When the objects are extracted from the archive, the
multiple references to objects are resolved, and an equivalent graph of objects
is reestablished.<p>

<b>Initializing an NSArchiver</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (id)<b>initForWritingWithMutableData:</b>(NSMutableData *)<i>mdata</i>	
	Initializes an archiver, encoding stream and version information into mutable
data <i>mdata</i>. Raises NSInvalidArgumentException if the <i>mdata</i>
argument is <b>nil</b>.</LI></UL>
<b>Archiving Data </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSData *)<b>archivedDataWithRootObject:</b>(id)<i>rootObject</i>	
	Creates and returns a data object after initializing an archiver with that
object and encoding the archiver with <i>rootObject</i>.
</LI><LI> +  (BOOL)<b>archiveRootObject:</b>(id)<i>rootObject</i>	Archives<i>
rootObject</i> by encoding it as a data object in
<b>toFile:</b>(NSString *)<i>path</i>		an archiver and writing that data object
to file <i>path</i>. Returns YES upon success.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>encodeArrayOfObjCType:</b>(const char *)<i>type</i>	 Encodes an
<i>array</i> of <i>count</i> data elements of the same 
<b>count:</b>(unsigned int)<i>count</i>		Objective C data <i>type</i>.<i>
</i>
<i></i><b>at:</b>(const void *)<i>array</i>
<i></i></LI><LI> -  (void)<b>encodeConditionalObject:</b>(id)<i>object</i>	Encodes into the
linearized data a conditional <i>object</i> that points back toward a root
object. If <b>nil</b> is specified for <i>object</i>, it encodes it as
<b>nil</b> unconditionally. Raises an NSInvalidArgumentException if no root
object has been encoded.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>encodeRootObject:</b>(id)<i>rootObject</i>	Encodes the
<i>rootObject</i> at the start of the linearized data representing the object
graph. Raises an NSInvalidArgumentException if the root object has already been
encoded.</LI></UL>
<b>Getting Data from the NSArchiver</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSMutableData *)<b>archiverData</b>	Returns the data object, in mutable
form, that is associated with the receiving NSArchiver.</LI></UL>
<b>Substituting One Class for Another </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSString *)<b>classNameEncodedForTrueClassName:</b>(NSString
*)<i>trueName</i>
<i></i>	Returns the class name used to archive instances of the class
<i>trueName</i>. See <b>encodeClassName:intoClassName</b>.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>encodeClassName:</b>(NSString *)<i>trueName</i>	Encodes in the
archive a substitute class name 
<b>intoClassName:</b>(NSString *)<i>inArchiveName</i>)		for the real class name
(<i>trueName</i>).

<b>Class Description</b><p>


The Foundation Kit uses the NSAutoreleasePool class to implement NSObject's
<b>autorelease</b> method. An autorelease pool simply contains other objects,
and when deallocated, sends a <b>release</b> message to each of those objects.
An object can be put into the same pool several times, and receives a
<b>release</b> message for each time it was put into the pool. <p>
<p>
You use autorelease pools to limit the time an object remains valid after it's
been autoreleased (that is, after it's been sent
an <b>autorelease</b> message or has otherwise been added to an autorelease
pool). Autorelease pools are created using the usual <b>alloc</b> and
<b>init</b> messages, and disposed of with <b>release</b>. An autorelease pool
should always be released in the same context (invocation of a method or
function, or body of a loop) that it was created. You should never send
<b>retain</b> or <b>autorelease</b> messages to an autorelease pool.<p>
<p>
Autorelease pools are automatically created and destroyed in OpenStep
applications, so your code normally doesn't have to worry about them. There are
two cases, though, where you should explicitly create and destroy your own
autorelease pools. If you're writing a program that's not based on the
Application Kit, such as a UNIX tool, there's no built-in support for
autorelease pools; you must create and destroy them yourself. Also, if you need
to write a loop that creates many temporary objects, you should create an
autorelease pool in the loop to prevent too long a delay in the disposal of
those objects.<p>
<p>
Enabling the autorelease feature in a program that's not based on the
Application Kit is easy. Many programs have a top-level loop where they do most
of their work. To enable the autorelease feature you create an autorelease pool
at the beginning of this loop and release it at the end. An <b>autorelease</b>
message sent in the body of the loop automatically puts its receiver into this
pool. The <b>main()</b> function might look like this:<p>
<p>
<tt>int main(int argc, char *argv[])</tt><p>
<tt>{</tt><p>
<tt>    int i;</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>    /* Do whatever setup is needed. */</tt><p>
<tt>    for (i = 0; i &lt; argc; i++) {</tt><p>
<tt>        NSAutoreleasePool *pool;</tt><p>
<tt>        NSString *fileContents;</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>        NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];</tt><p>
<tt>        fileContents = [[[NSString alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:argv[i]]
autorelease];</tt><p>
<tt>        processFile(fileContents);</tt><p>
<tt>        [pool release];</tt><p>
<tt>    }</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>    /* Do whatever cleanup is needed. */</tt><p>
<tt>    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);</tt><p>
<tt>}</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
Any object autoreleased inside the <b>for</b> loop, such as the
<b>fileContents</b> string object, is added to <b>pool</b>, and when
<b>pool</b> is released at the end of the loop those objects are also
released.<p>
<p>
Note that autoreleasing doesn't work outside of the loop. This isn't a problem,
since the program terminates shortly after the loop ends, and memory leaks
aren't usually serious at that stage of execution. Your cleanup code shouldn't
refer to any objects created inside the loop, though, since they may be
autoreleased in the loop and therefore released as soon as it ends.<p>
<p>

<b>Nesting Autorelease Pools</b><p>

You may need to manually create and destroy autorelease pools even in an
application that uses the Application Kit if you write loops that create many
temporary objects. For example, if you write a loop that iterates 1000 times
and invokes a method that creates 15 temporary objects, those 15,000 objects
will remain until the application's autorelease pool is deallocated, possibly
well after they're no longer needed.<p>
<p>
You can create your own autorelease pools within the loop to prevent these
unwanted objects from remaining around. Autorelease pools nest themselves on a
per-thread basis, so that if you create your own pool, it adds itself to the
application's default pool, forming a stack of autorelease pools. Likewise, if
you create another pool (within a nested loop, perhaps), it adds itself to the
first pool you created. <b>autorelease</b> automatically adds its receiver to
the last pool created, creating a nesting of autorelease contexts. The
implications of this are described below.<p>
<p>
A method that creates autorelease pools looks much like the <b>main()</b>
function given above:<p>
<p>
<tt>- (void)processString:(NSString *)aString</tt><p>
<tt>{</tt><p>
<tt>    int i;</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>    for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {</tt><p>
<tt>        NSAutoreleasePool *subpool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc]
init];</tt><p>
<tt>        NSString *thisLine;</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>        thisLine = [self lineNumbered:i fromString:aString];</tt><p>
<tt>        /* Do some work with thisLine. */</tt><p>
<tt>        [subpool release];</tt><p>
<tt>    }</tt><p>
<tt>    return;</tt><p>
<tt>}</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
If you assume that <b>lineNumbered:fromString:</b> returns a string object
that's been autoreleased while <b>subpool</b> is in effect, that object is
released with <b>subpool</b> at the end of the loop. The work involving
<b>thisLine</b> may create other temporary objects, which are also released at
the end of the loop. None of these objects remains outside of this loop or the
<b>processString:</b> method (unless they've been retained).<p>
<p>
Note that because an autorelease pool adds itself to the previous pool when
created, it doesn't cause a memory leak in the face of an exception or other
sudden transfer out of the current context. If an exception occurs in the above
loop, or if the work in the loop involves immediately returning or breaking out
of the loop, the sub-pool is released by the application's default pool (or
whatever pool was in effect before the sub-pool was created),
unwinding the autorelease-pool stack up to the
one that's supposed to be active.<p>
<p>

<b>Guaranteeing the Foundation Ownership Policy</b><p>

By manually creating an autorelease pool, you reduce the potential lifetime of
temporary objects to the lifetime of that pool. After an autorelease pool is
deallocated, you should regard as disposed of
any object that was autoreleased while that pool was in effect, and not send a
message to that object or return it to the invoker of your method. This method,
for example, is incorrect:<p>
<p>
-<tt> findMatchingObject:anObject</tt><p>
<tt>{</tt><p>
<tt>    id match = nil;</tt><p>
<tt>    while (match == nil) {</tt><p>
<tt>        NSAutoreleasePool *subpool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc]
init];</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>       /* Do some searching that creates a lot of temporary
objects.*/</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>        match = [self expensiveSearchForObject:anObject];</tt><p>
<tt>        [subpool release];</tt><p>
<tt>    }</tt><p>
<tt>    /* Danger!! The match object may not exist at this point! */</tt><p>
<tt>    [match setIsMatch:YES forObject:anObject];</tt><p>
<tt>    return match;</tt><p>
<tt>}</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<b>expensiveSearchForObject:</b> is invoked while <b>subpool</b> is in effect,
which means that <b>match</b>, which may have been autoreleased, is released at
the bottom of the loop. Sending <b>setIsMatch:forObject:</b> after the loop
could cause the application to crash. Similarly, returning <b>match</b> allows
the sender of <b>findMatchingObject:</b> to send a message to it, also causing
your application to crash.<p>
<p>
If you must pull a temporary object out of a nested autorelease context, you
can do so by retaining the object within the context and then autoreleasing it
after the pool has been released. Here's a correct implementation of
<b>findMatchingObject:</b>:<p>
<p>
-<tt> findMatchingObject:anObject</tt><p>
<tt>{</tt><p>
<tt>    id match = nil;</tt><p>
<tt>    while (match == nil) {</tt><p>
<tt>        NSAutoreleasePool *subpool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc]
init];</tt><p>
<tt>    </tt><p>
<tt>		</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>        /* Do a search that creates a lot of temporary objects. */</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>        match = [self expensiveSearchForObject:anObject];</tt><p>
<tt>        if (match != nil) [match retain]; /* Keep match around. */</tt><p>
<tt>        [subpool release];</tt><p>
<tt>    }</tt><p>
<tt>    [match setIsMatch:YES forObject:anObject];</tt><p>
<tt>    return [match autorelease];   /* Let match go and return it. */</tt><p>
<tt>}</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
By retaining <b>match</b> while <b>subpool</b> is in effect and autoreleasing
it after the <b>subpool</b> has been released, <b>match</b> is effectively
moved from <b>subpool</b> to the pool that was previously in effect. This gives
it a longer lifetime and allows it to be sent messages outside the loop and to
be returned to the invoker of <b>findMatchingObject:</b>.<p>
<p>

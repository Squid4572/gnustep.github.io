<b>NSMutableCopying </b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Adopted By:	</b>various OpenStep classes<p>
<p>
<b>Declared In:	</b>Foundation/NSObject.h <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Protocol Description</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
A class that defines an immutable vs. mutable
distinction adopts this protocol to allow mutable copies of its instances to be
made. A mutable copy of an object is usually a <i>shallow copy</i> (as opposed
to the <i>deep copy</i> defined in the NSCopying protocol specification). The
original and its copy share references to the same instance variables, so that
if a component of the copy is changed, for example, that change is reflected in
the original.<p>
<p>
A class that doesn't define an immutable vs.
mutable distinction but that needs to offer both deep and
shallow copying shouldn't adopt this protocol. The NSCopying methods should by
default be assumed to produce deep copies; the class can then also implement
methods to produce shallow copies.<p>
<p>
Contrary to most methods, the returned value is owned by the caller, who is
responsible for releasing it.<p>

<b>Making Mutable Copies of Objects</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
- (id)<b>mutableCopyWithZone:</b>(NSZone *)<i>zone</i>	Returns a new instance
that's a top level, mutable copy of the receiver. For a collection, objects in
the collection are retained. Memory for the new instance is allocated from
<i>zone</i>. The returned object is owned by the caller, who is responsible for
releasing it.<p>

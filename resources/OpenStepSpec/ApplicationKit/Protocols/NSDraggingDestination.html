<b>NSDraggingDestination</b><p>
<b>(informal protocol)</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Category Of:</b>	NSObject<p>
<p>
<b>Declared In:	</b>AppKit/NSDragging.h<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Protocol Description</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
The NSDraggingDestination protocol declares methods that the destination (or
recipient) of a dragged image must implement. The destination automatically
receives NSDraggingDestination messages as an image enters, moves around
inside, and then exits or is released within the destination's boundaries.<p>
<p>
<b>Note:  </b>In the text here and in the other dragging protocol descriptions,
the term <i>dragging session</i> is the entire process during which an image is
selected, dragged, released, and is absorbed or rejected by the destination. A
<i>dragging operation</i> is the action that the destination takes in absorbing
the image when it's released. The <i>dragging source</i> is the object that
owns the image that's being dragged. It's
specified as an argument to the <b>dragImage:...</b> message, sent to a
NSWindow or NSView, that instigated the dragging session.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>The Dragged Image</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The image that's dragged in an image-dragging session is an NSImage object that
represents data that's put on the pasteboard. Although a dragging destination
can access the NSImage (through a method described in the NSDraggingInfo
protocol), its primary concern is with the pasteboard data that the NSImage
representsthe dragging operation that a destination ultimately performs
is on the pasteboard data, not on the image itself.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Valid Destinations</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Dragging is a visual phenomenon. To be an image-dragging destination, an object
must represent a portion of screen real estate; thus, only NSWindows and
NSViews can be destinations.   Furthermore, you must announce the
destination-candidacy of an NSWindow or NSView by sending it a
<b>registerForDraggedTypes:</b> message. This method, defined in both classes,
registers the pasteboard types that the object will accept. During a dragging
session, a candidate destination will only receive NSDraggingDestination
messages if the pasteboard types for which it is registered matches a type
that's represented by the image that's being dragged.<p>
<p>
Although NSDraggingDestination is declared as a protocol, the NSView and
NSWindow subclasses that you create to adopt the protocol need only implement
those methods that are pertinent. (The NSView and NSWindow classes provide
private implementations for all of the methods.) In addition, an NSWindow or
its delegate may implement these methods; the delegate's implementation takes
precedent. <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>The Sender of Destination Messages</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Each of the NSDraggingDestination methods sports a single argument:
<i>sender</i>, the object that invoked the method. Within its implementations
of the NSDraggingDestination methods, the destination can send NSDraggingInfo
messages to <i>sender</i> to get more information on the current dragging
session. <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>The Order of Destination Messages</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The six NSDraggingDestination methods are invoked in a distinct order:<p>
<p>
.	As the image is dragged into the destination's boundaries, the destination is
sent a <b>draggingEntered: </b>message.<p>
<p>
.	While the image remains within the destination, a series of
<b>draggingUpdated:</b> messages are sent.<p>
<p>
.	If the image is dragged out of the destination, <b>draggingExited:</b> is
sent and the sequence of NSDraggingDestination messages stops. If it re-enters,
the sequence begins again (with a new <b>draggingEntered: </b>message).<p>
<p>
.	When the image is released, it either slides back to its source (and breaks
the sequence) or a <b>prepareForDragOperation:</b> message is sent to the
destination, depending on the value that was returned by the most recent
invocation of<b> draggingEntered:</b> or <b>draggingUpdated:</b>.<p>
<p>
.	If the <b>prepareForDragOperation:</b> message returned YES, a
<b>performDragOperation:</b> message is sent.<p>
<p>
.	Finally, if <b>performDragOperation: </b>returned YES,
<b>concludeDragOperation:</b> is sent.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Before the Image is Released</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
- (NSDragOperation)<b>draggingEntered:</b>(id
&lt;NSDraggingInfo&gt;)<i>sender</i><p>
<i></i>	Invoked when the dragged image enters the destination.<p>
<p>
- (NSDragOperation)<b>draggingUpdated:</b>(id
&lt;NSDraggingInfo&gt;)<i>sender</i><p>
<i></i>	Invoked periodically while the image is over the destination.<p>
<p>
- (void)<b>draggingExited:</b>(id &lt;NSDraggingInfo&gt;)<i>sender</i><p>
<i>	</i>Invoked when the dragged image exits the destination.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>After the Image is Released</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
- (BOOL)<b>prepareForDragOperation:</b>(id
&lt;NSDraggingInfo&gt;)<i>sender</i><p>
<i></i>	Invoked when the image is released.<p>
<p>
 - (BOOL)<b>performDragOperation:</b>(id &lt;NSDraggingInfo&gt;)<i>sender</i><p>
<i></i>	Gives the destination an opportunity to perform the dragging
operation.<p>
<p>
- (void)<b>concludeDragOperation:</b>(id &lt;NSDraggingInfo&gt;)<i>sender</i><p>
<i></i>	Invoked when the dragging operation is complete.<p>

<b>NSMenuActionResponder</b><p>
<b>(informal protocol)</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Category Of:	</b>NSObject<p>
<p>
<b>Declared In:	</b>AppKit/NSMenu.h <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Protocol Description</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
This informal protocol allows your application to update the enabled or
disabled status of an NSMenuCell. It declares only one method,
<b>validateCell:</b>. By default, every time a user event occurs, NSMenu
automatically enables and disables each visible menu cell based on criteria
described later in this specification. Implement <b>validateCell:</b> in cases
where you want to override NSMenu's default enabling scheme. This is described
in more detail later.<p>
<p>
There are two ways that NSMenuCells can be enabled or disabled: Explicitly, by
sending the <b>setEnabled:</b> message, or automatically, as described below.
NSMenuCells are updated automatically unless you send the message
<b>setAutoenablesItems:NO</b> to the NSMenu object. You should never mix the
two. That is, never use <b>setEnabled:</b> unless you have disabled the
automatic updating. <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Automatic Updating of NSMenuCells</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Whenever a user event occurs, the NSMenu object updates the status of every
visible menu cell. To update the status of a menu cell, NSMenu tries to find
the object that responds to the NSMenuCell's action message. It searches the
following objects in the following order until it finds one that responds to
the action message. <p>
<p>
.	the NSMenuCell's target<p>
<p>
.	the key window's first responder<p>
<p>
.	the key window's delegate<p>
<p>
.	the main window's first responder<p>
<p>
.	the main window's delegate<p>
<p>
.	the NSApplication object<p>
<p>
.	the NSApplication's delegate<p>
<p>
.	the NSMenu's delegate<p>
<p>
If none of these objects responds to the action message, the menu cell is
disabled. If NSMenu finds an object that responds to the action message, it
then checks to see if that object responds to the <b>validateCell:</b> message
(the method defined in this informal protocol). If <b>validateCell:</b> is not
implemented in that object, the menu cell is enabled. If it is implemented, the
return value of <b>validateCell:</b> indicates whether the menu cell should be
enabled or disabled.<p>
<p>
For example, the NSText object implements the <b>copy:</b> method. If your
application has a Copy menu cell that sends the <b>copy:</b> action message to
the first responder, that menu cell is automatically enabled any time an NSText
object is the first responder of the key or main window. If you have an object
that might become the first responder and that object could allow users to
select something that they aren't allowed to copy, you can implement the
<b>validateCell:</b> method in that object. <b>validateCell:</b> can return NO
if the forbidden items are selected and YES if they aren't. By implementing
<b>validateCell:</b>, you can have the Copy menu item disabled even though its
target object implements the <b>copy:</b> method. If instead your object
<i>never</i> permits copying, then you would simply not implement <b>copy:</b>
in that object, and the cell would be disabled automatically whenever the
object is first responder.<p>
<p>
If you send a <b>setEnabled:</b> message to enable or disable a menu cell when
the automatic updating is turned on, other objects might reverse what you have
done after another user event occurs. Using <b>setEnabled:</b>, you can never
be sure that a menu cell is enabled or disabled or will remain that way. If
your application must use <b>setEnabled:</b>, you must turn off the automatic
enabling of menu cells (by sending <b>setAutoEnablesItems:NO</b> to NSMenu) in
order to get predictable results.<p>

<b>Updating NSMenuCells</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
- (BOOL)<b>validateCell:</b>(id)<i>aCell	</i>Implemented to override the
default action of updating an NSMenuCell. Return YES to enable the NSMenuCell,
NO to disable it.<p>

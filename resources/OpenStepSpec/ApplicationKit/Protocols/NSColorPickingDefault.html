<b>NSColorPickingDefault</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Adopted By:	</b>NSColorPicker<p>
<p>
<b>Declared In:	</b>AppKit/NSColorPicking.h<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Protocol Description</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
The NSColorPickingDefault protocol, together with the NSColorPickingCustom
protocol, provides an interface for adding color pickerscustom user
interfaces for color selectionto an application's NSColorPanel. The
NSColorPickingDefault protocol provides basic behavior for a color picker. The
NSColorPickingCustom protocol provides implementation-specific behavior. <p>
<p>
The NSColorPicker class implements the NSColorPickingDefault protocol. The
simplest way to implement your own color picker is to create a subclass of
NSColorPicker, implementing the NSColorPickingCustom protocol in that subclass.
However, it's possible to create a subclass of another class, such as NSView,
and use it as a base upon which to add the methods of both
NSColorPickingDefault and NSColorPickingCustom.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Color Picker Bundles</b><p>
<b></b><p>
A class that implements the NSColorPickingDefault and NSColorPickingCustom
protocols needs to be compiled and linked in an application's object file.
However, your application need not explicitly create an instance of this class.
Instead, your application's file package should include a directory named
<b>ColorPickers</b>; within this directory you should place a directory
<i>MyPickerClass</i>.bundle for each custom color picker your application
implements. This bundle should contain all resources required for your color
picker: nib files, TIFF files, and so on. <p>
<p>
NSColorPanel will allocate and initialize an instance of each class for which a
bundle is found in the <b>ColorPickers</b> directory. The class name is assumed
to be the bundle directory name minus the <b>.bundle</b> extension.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Color Picker Buttons</b><p>
<b></b><p>
NSColorPanel lets the user select a color picker from a matrix of
NSButtonCells. This protocol includes methods for providing and manipulating
the image that gets displayed on the button.<p>

(class)<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Initializing a Color Picker </b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
- (id)<b>initWithPickerMask:</b>(int)<i>mask</i>	Initializes the receiver for
the specified mask and color<p>
<b>colorPanel:</b>(NSColorPanel *)<i>colorPanel</i>		panel. This method is sent
by the NSColorPanel to all implementors of the color picking protocols when the
application's color panel is first initialized. If the color picker responds to
any of the modes represented in <i>mask</i>, it should perform its
initialization (if desired) and return <b>self</b>; otherwise it should do
nothing and return <b>nil</b>. However, a custom color picker can instead delay
initialization until it receives a <b>provideNewView: </b>message.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Adding Button Images </b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
- (void)<b>insertNewButtonImage:</b>(NSImage *)<i>newImage</i> <p>
<b>in:</b>(NSButtonCell *)<i>newButtonCell</i>	Sets <i>newImage</i> as
<i>newButtonCell</i>'s image. <i>newButtonCell</i> is the NSButtonCell object
that lets the user choose the picker from the color panel. This method should
perform application-specific manipulation of the image before it's inserted and
displayed by the button cell.<p>
<p>
- (NSImage *)<b>provideNewButtonImage</b>	Returns the image for the mode button
that the user uses to select this picker in the color panel. (This is the same
image that the color panel uses as an argument when sending the
<b>insertNewButtonImage:in: </b>message.)<b> </b><p>
<b></b><p>
Setting the Mode <p>
<p>
<p>
- (void)<b>setMode:</b>(int)<i>mode</i>	Sets the color picker's mode. This
method is invoked by NSColorPanel's <b>setMode:</b> method to ensure that the
color picker reflects the current mode. Most color pickers have only one mode,
and thus don't need to do any work in this method. Others, like the standard
sliders picker, have multiple modes.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Using Color Lists </b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
- (void)<b>attachColorList:</b>(NSColorList *)<i>aColorList</i>	Attaches the
given color list to the receiver, if it isn't already displaying the list. This
method is invoked automatically by the NSColorPanel when its
<b>attachColorList:</b> method is invoked. Since NSColorPanel's list mode
manages NSColorLists, this method need only be implemented by a custom color
picker that manages NSColorLists itself. <p>
<p>
- (void)<b>detachColorList:</b>(NSColorList *)<i>aColorList</i>	Removes the
given color list from the receiver, unless the receiver isn't displaying the
list. This method is invoked automatically by the NSColorPanel when its
<b>detachColorList:</b> method is invoked. Since NSColorPanel's list mode
manages NSColorLists, this method need only be implemented by a custom color
picker that manages NSColorLists itself. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Showing Opacity Controls</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
- (void)<b>alphaControlAddedOrRemoved:</b>(id)<i>sender</i>	Sent by the color
panel<i> </i>when the opacity controls have been hidden or displayed. If the
color picker<i> </i>has its own opacity controls, it should hide or display
them, depending on whether the sender's <b>showsAlpha</b><i> </i>method returns
NO or YES.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Responding to a Resized View </b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
- (void)<b>viewSizeChanged:</b>(id)<i>sender</i>	Sent when the color picker's
superview has been resized in a way that might affect the color picker.
<i>sender </i>is the NSColorPanel that contains the color picker. <p>

<b>NSNibAwaking</b><p>
<b>(informal protocol)</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Category Of:	</b>NSObject<p>
<p>
<b>Declared In:	</b>AppKit/NSNibLoading.h<p>

<b>Protocol Description</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
This informal protocol consists of a single method, <b>awakeFromNib</b>. It's
implemented to receive a notification message that's sent after objects have
been loaded from an Interface Builder archive.<p>
<p>
When <b>loadNibFile:owner:</b> or a related method loads an Interface Builder
archive into an application, each custom object from the archive is first
initialized with an <b>init</b> message (<b>initFrame:</b> if the object is a
kind of View). Outlets are initialized via any <b>set</b><i>Variable</i>:
methods that are available (where <i>variable</i> is the name of an instance
variable). (These methods are optional; the Objective C run time system
automatically initializes outlets.) Finally, after all the objects are fully
initialized, they each receive an <b>awakeFromNib</b> message.<p>
<p>
The order in which objects are loaded from the archive is not guaranteed.
Therefore, it's possible for a <b>set</b><i>Variable</i>: message to be sent to
an object before its companion objects have been unarchived. For this reason,
<b>set</b><i>Variable</i>: methods should not send messages to other objects in
the archive. However, messages to other objects can safely be sent from within
<b>awakeFromNib</b>by this point it's assured that all the objects are
unarchived and fully initialized. <p>
<p>
Typically, <b>awakeFromNib</b> is implemented for only one object in the
archive, the controlling or owner object for the
other objects that are archived with it. For example, suppose that a nib file
contained two Views that must be positioned relative to each other at run time.
Trying to position them when either one of the Views is initialized (in a
<b>set</b><i>Variable</i>: method) might fail, since the other View might not
be unarchived and initialized yet. However, it can be done in an
<b>awakeFromNib</b> method:<p>
<p>
<tt>- awakeFromNib</tt><p>
<tt>{</tt><p>
<tt>    NXRect viewFrame;</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>    [firstView getFrame:&amp;viewFrame];</tt><p>
<tt>    [secondView moveTo:viewFrame.origin.x + someVariable</tt><p>
<tt>                    :viewFrame.origin.y];</tt><p>
<tt>    return self;</tt><p>
<tt>}</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
There's no default <b>awakeFromNib</b> method; an <b>awakeFromNib</b> message
is only sent if an object implements it. The Application Kit declares a
prototype for this method, but doesn't implement it.<p>

<b>Notification of Loading</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
- (void)<b>awakeFromNib</b><i>	</i>Implemented to prepare an object for service
after it has been loaded from an Interface Builder archivea so-called
nib file. An <b>awakeFromNib</b> message is sent
to each object loaded from the archive, but only if it can respond to the
message, and only after all the objects in the archive have been loaded and
initialized. When an object receives an <b>awakeFromNib</b> message, it's
already guaranteed to have all its outlet instance variables set. There's no
default <b>awakeFromNib</b> method. <p>

<b>NSDraggingInfo</b><p>

<b>Adopted By:	</b>no OpenStep classes<p>

<b>Protocol Description</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
The NSDraggingInfo protocol declares methods that supply information about a
dragging session (see the NSDraggingDestination protocol, an informal protocol
of NSObject, for definitions of dragging terms). A view or window first
registers dragging types; it may then send NSDraggingInfo protocol messages
while dragging occurs to get details about that dragging session.<p>
<p>
NSDraggingInfo methods are designed to be invoked from within an object's
implementation of the NSDraggingDestination protocol methods. An object that
conforms to NSDraggingInfo is passed as the argument to each of the methods
defined by NSDraggingDestination; NSDraggingInfo messages should be sent to
this conforming object. The Application Kit supplies an NSDraggingInfo object
automatically so that you never need to create a class that implements this
protocol.<p>

<b>Dragging-Session Information</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
- (NSWindow *)<b>draggingDestinationWindow	</b>Returns the destination's
Window.<p>
<p>
- (NSPoint)<b>draggingLocation	</b>Returns the current location of the cursor's
hot spot, reckoned in the base coordinate system of the destination object's
Window.<p>
<p>
- (NSPasteboard *)<b>draggingPasteboard	</b>Returns the Pasteboard that holds
the dragged data.<p>
<p>
- (int)<b>draggingSequenceNumber	</b>Returns a number that uniquely identifies
the dragging session.<p>
<p>
- (id)<b>draggingSource	</b>Returns the source, or
owner, of the dragged image. Returns <b>nil</b>
if the source isn't in the same application as the destination.<p>
<p>
- (NSDragOperation)<b>draggingSourceOperationMask</b><p>
<b></b>	Returns the operation mask declared by the source.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Image Information</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
- (NSImage *)<b>draggedImage	</b>Returns the image object that's being dragged.
Don't invoke this method after the user has released the image, and don't
release the object that this method returns.<p>
<p>
- (NSPoint)<b>draggedImageLocation	</b>Returns the current location of the
dragged image's origin. The image moves in lockstep with the cursor (the
position of which is given by <b>draggingLocation</b>) but may be positioned at
some offset. The point that's returned is reckoned in the base coordinate
system of the destination object's Window.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Sliding the Image</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
- (void)<b>slideDraggedImageTo:</b>(NSPoint)<i>screenPoint</i><p>
<i>	</i>Slides the image to the given location in the screen coordinate system.
This method should only be invoked after the user has released the image but
before it's removed from the screen.<p>

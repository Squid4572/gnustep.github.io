<b>NSSpellServer </b><p>

<B>Inherits From: </B><A HREF="NSObject.html">NSObject</A><p>

<b>Conforms To:	</b>NSObject (NSObject)

<b>Class Description</b><p>


The NSSpellServer class gives you a way to make your particular spelling
checker a service that's available to any application. A <i>service</i> is an
application that declares its availability in a standard way, so that any other
applications that wish to use it can do so. If you build a spelling checker
that makes use of the NSSpellServer class and list it as an available service,
then users of any application that makes use of NSSpellChecker or includes a
Services menu will see your spelling checker as one of the available
dictionaries.<p>
<p>
To make use of NSSpellServer, you write a small program that creates an
NSSpellServer instance and a delegate that responds to messages asking it to
find a misspelled word and to suggest guesses for a misspelled word. Send the
NSSpellServer <b>registerLanguage:byVendor:</b> messages to tell it the
languages your delegate can handle.<p>
<p>
The program that runs your spelling checker should not be built as an
Application Kit application, but as a simple program. Suppose you supply
spelling checkers under the vendor name Acme.
Suppose the file containing the code for your delegate is called
AcmeEnglishSpellChecker. Then the following might be your program's
<b>main</b>:<p>
<p>
<tt>void main()</tt><p>
<tt>{</tt><p>
<tt>  NSSpellServer *aServer = [[NSSpellServer alloc] init];</tt><p>
<tt>  if ([aServer registerLanguage:"English" byVendor:"Acme"]) {</tt><p>
<tt>    [aServer setDelegate:[AcmeEnglishSpellChecker alloc] init]];</tt><p>
<tt>    [aServer run];</tt><p>
<tt>    fprintf(stderr, "Unexpected death of Acme SpellChecker!\n");</tt><p>
<tt>  } else {</tt><p>
<tt>    fprintf(stderr, "Unable to check in Acme SpellChecker.\n");</tt><p>
<tt>  }</tt><p>
<tt>}</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
Your delegate is an instance of a custom subclass. (It's simplest to make it a
subclass of NSObject, but that's not a requirement.) Given an NSString, your
delegate must be able to find a misspelled word by implementing the method<b>
spellServer:findMisspelledWordInString:language:wordCount:countOnly:</b>.
Usually, this method also reports the number of words it has scanned, but that
isn't mandatory.<p>
<p>
Optionally, the delegate may also suggest corrections for misspelled words. It
does so by implementing the method
<b>spellServer:suggestGuessesForWord:inLanguage:</b><p>


Service Availability Notice<p>
<p>
When there's more than one spelling checker available, the user selects the one
desired. The application that requests a spelling check uses an NSSpellChecker
object, and it provides a Spelling panel; in the panel there's a pop-up list of
available spelling checkers. Your spelling checker appears in that list if it
has a <i>service descriptor</i>.<p>
<p>
A service descriptor is an entry in a text file called <b>services</b>. Usually
it's located within the bundle that also contains your spelling checker's
executable file. The bundle (or directory) that contains the services file must
have a name ending in .service or
.app. The system looks for service bundles in a
standard set of directories.<p>
<p>
A spell checker service availability notice has a standard format, illustrated
in the following example for the Acme spelling checker:<p>
<p>
<tt>Spell Checker:  Acme</tt><p>
<tt>Language:  French</tt><p>
<tt>Language:  English</tt><p>
<tt>Executable:  franglais.daemon</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
The first line identifies the type of service; for a spelling checker, it must
say Spell Checker: followed by your vendor name.
The next line contains the English name of a language your spelling checker is
prepared to check. (The language must be one your system recognizes.) If your
program can check more than one language, use an additional line for each
additional language. The last line of a descriptor gives the name of the
service's executable file. (It requires a complete path if it's in a different
directory.) <p>
<p>
If there's a service descriptor for your Acme spelling checker and also a
service descriptor for the English checker provided by a vendor named
Consolidated, a user looking at the Spelling panel's pop-up list would see:<p>
<p>
<tt>English (Acme)</tt><p>
<tt>English (Consolidated)</tt><p>
<tt>French (Acme)</tt><p>
<tt></tt>
<b>Illustrative Sequence of Messages to an NSSpellServer</b><p>

The act of checking spelling usually involves the interplay of objects in two
classes: the user application's NSSpellChecker (which responds to interactions
with the user) and your spelling checker's NSSpellServer (which provides the
application interface for your spelling checker). You can see the interaction
between the two in the following list of steps involved in finding a misspelled
word.<p>
<p>
.	The user of an application selects a menu item to request a spelling check.
The application sends a message to its NSSpellChecker object. The
NSSpellChecker in turn sends a corresponding message to the appropriate
NSSpellServer.<p>
<p>
.	The NSSpellServer receives the message asking it to check the spelling of an
NSString. It forwards the message to its delegate.<p>
<p>
.	The delegate searches for a misspelled word. If it finds one, it returns an
NSRange identifying the word's location in the string. <p>
<p>
.	The NSSpellServer receives a message asking it to suggest guesses for the
correct spelling of a misspelled word, and forwards the message to its
delegate.<p>
<p>
.	The delegate returns a list of possible corrections, which the NSSpellServer
in turn returns to the NSSpellChecker that initiated the request.<p>
<p>
.	The NSSpellServer doesn't know what the user does with the errors its
delegate has found or with the guesses its delegate has proposed. (Perhaps the
user corrects the document, perhaps by selecting a correction from the
NSSpellChecker's display of guesses; but that's not the NSSpellServer's
responsibility.) However, if the user presses the Learn or Forget buttons
(thereby causing the NSSpellChecker to revise the user's word list), the
NSSpellServer receives a notification of the word thus learned or forgotten.
It's up to you whether your spell checker acts on this information. If the user
presses the Ignore button, the delegate is not notified (but the next time that
word occurs in the text, the method <b>isWordInUserDictionaries:caseSensitive:
</b>will report YES rather than NO).<p>
<p>
.	Once the NSSpellServer delegate has reported a misspelled word, it has
completed its search. Of course, it's likely that the user's application will
then send a new message, this time asking the NSSpellServer to check a string
containing the part of the text it didn't get to earlier.<p>

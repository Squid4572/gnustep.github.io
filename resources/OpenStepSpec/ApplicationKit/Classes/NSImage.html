<b>Class Description</b><p>


An NSImage object contains an image that can be composited anywhere without
first being drawn in any particular view. It manages the image by:<p>
<p>
.	Reading image data from the application bundle, from an NSPasteboard, or from
an NSData object.<p>
<p>
.	Keeping multiple representations of the same image.<p>
<p>
.	Choosing the representation that's appropriate for a particular data type.<p>
<p>
.	Choosing the representation that's appropriate for any given display
device.<p>
<p>
.	Caching the representations it uses by rendering them in off-screen
windows.<p>
<p>
.	Optionally retaining the data used to draw the representations, so that they
can be reproduced when needed.<p>
<p>
.	Compositing the image from the off-screen cache to where it's needed
on-screen.<p>
<p>
.	Reproducing the image for the printer so that it matches what's displayed
on-screen, yet is the best representation possible for the printed page.<p>
<p>
.	Automatically using any filtering services installed by the user to convert
image data from unsupported formats to supported formats. <p>
<p>

<b>Defining an Image</b><p>

An image can be created from various types of data:<p>
<p>
.	Encapsulated PostScript code (EPS)<p>
<p>
.	Bitmap data in Tag Image File Format (TIFF)<p>
<p>
.	Untagged (raw) bitmap data <p>
<p>
.	Other image data supported by an NSImageRep subclass registered with the
NSImage class<p>
<p>
.	Data that can be filtered to a supported type by a user-installed filter
service<p>
<p>
If data is placed in a file (for example, in an application bundle), the
NSImage object can access the data whenever it's needed to create the image. If
data is read from an NSData object, the NSImage object may need to store the
data itself.<p>
<p>
Images can also be defined by the program, in two ways:<p>
<p>
.	By drawing the image in an off-screen window maintained by the NSImage
object. In this case, the NSImage maintains only the cached image.<p>
<p>
.	By defining a method that can be used to draw the image when needed. This
allows the NSImage to delegate responsibility for producing the image to some
other object.<p>
<p>

<b>Image Representations</b><p>

An NSImage object can keep more than one representation of an image. Multiple
representations permit the image to be customized for the display device. For
example, different hand-tuned TIFF images can be provided for monochrome and
color screens, and an EPS representation or a custom method might be used for
printing. All representations are versions of the same image.<p>
<p>
An NSImage returns an NSArray of its representations in response to a
<b>representations</b> message. Each representation is a kind of NSImageRep
object:<p>
<p>
NSEPSImageRep	An image that can be recreated from EPS data that's either stored
by the object or at a known location in the file system.<p>
<p>
NSBitmapImageRep	An image that can be recreated from bitmap or TIFF data.<p>
<p>
NSCustomImageRep	An image that can be redrawn by a method defined in the
application.<p>
<p>
NSCachedImageRep	An image that has been rendered in an off-screen cache from
data or instructions that are no longer available. The image in the cache
provides the only data from which the image can be reproduced.<p>
<p>
You can define other NSImageRep subclasses for objects that render images from
other types of source data. To make these new subclasses available to an
NSImage object, they need to be added to the NSImageRep class registry by
invoking the <b>registerImageRepClass:</b> class method. NSImage determines the
data types that each subclass can support by invoking its
<b>imageUnfilteredFileTypes</b> and <b>imageUnfilteredPasteboardTypes</b>
methods.<p>
<p>

<b>Choosing Representations</b><p>

The NSImage object will choose the representation that best matches the
rendering device. By default, the choice is made according to the following set
of ordered rules. Each rule is applied in turn until the choice of
representation is narrowed to one.<p>
<p>
1.	Choose a color representation for a color device, and a gray-scale
representation for a monochrome device.<p>
<p>
2.	Choose a representation with a resolution that matches the resolution of the
device, or if no representation matches, choose the one with the highest
resolution.<p>
<p>
By default, any image representation with a resolution that's an integer
multiple of the device resolution is considered to match. If more than one
representation matches, the NSImage will choose the one that's closest to the
device resolution. However, you can force resolution matches to be exact by
passing NO to the <b>setMatchesOnMultipleResolution:</b> method.<p>
<p>
Rule 2 prefers TIFF and bitmap representations, which have a defined
resolution, over EPS representations, which don't. However, you can use the
<b>setUsesEPSOnResolutionMismatch:</b> method to have the NSImage choose an EPS
representation in case a resolution match isn't possible.<p>
<p>
3.	If all else fails, choose the representation with a specified bits per
sample that matches the depth of the device. If no representation matches,
choose the one with the highest bits per sample.<p>
<p>
By passing NO to the <b>setPrefersColorMatch:</b> method, you can have the
NSImage try for a resolution match before a color match. This essentially
inverts the first and second rules above.<p>
<p>
If these rules fail to narrow the choice to a single representationfor
example, if the NSImage has two color TIFF representations with the same
resolution and depththe one that will be chosen is system dependent.<p>
<p>

<b>Caching Representations</b><p>

When first asked to composite the image, the NSImage object chooses the
representation that's best for the destination display device, as outlined
above. It renders the representation in an off-screen window on the same
device, then composites it from this cache to the desired location. Subsequent
requests to composite the image use the same cache. Representations aren't
cached until they're needed for compositing.<p>
<p>
When printing, the NSImage tries not to use the cached image. Instead, it
attempts to render on the printerusing the appropriate image data, or a
delegated methodthe best version of the image that it can. Only as a
last resort will it image the cached bitmap.<p>
<p>

<b>Image Size</b><p>

Before an NSImage can be used, the size of the image must be set, in units of
the base coordinate system. If a representation is smaller or larger than the
specified size, it can be scaled to fit.<p>
<p>
If the size of the image hasn't already been set when the NSImage is provided
with a representation, the size will be set from the data. The bounding box is
used to determine the size of an NSEPSImageRep. The TIFF fields
ImageLength and
ImageWidth are used to determine the size of an
NSBitmapImageRep.<p>
<p>

<b>Coordinate Systems</b><p>

Images have the horizontal and vertical orientation of the base coordinate
system; they can't be rotated or flipped. When composited, an image maintains
this orientation, no matter what coordinate system it's composited to. (The
destination coordinate system is used only to determine the location of a
composited image, not its size or orientation.)<p>
<p>
It's possible to refer to portions of an image when compositing by specifying a
rectangle in the image's coordinate system, which is identical to the base
coordinate system, except that the origin is at the lower left corner of the
image.<p>
<p>

<b>Named Images</b><p>

An NSImage object can be identified either by its <b>id</b> or by a name.
Assigning an NSImage a name adds it to a table kept by the class object; each
name in the database identifies one and only one instance of the class. When
you ask for an NSImage object by name (with the <b>imageNamed:</b> method), the
class object returns the one from its database, which also includes all the
system bitmaps provided by the Application Kit.  If there's no object in the
database for the specified name, the class object tries to create one by
checking for a system bitmap of the same name, checking the name of the
application's own image, and then checking for the image in the application's
main bundle.<p>
<p>
If a section or file matches the name, an NSImage is created from the data
stored there. You can therefore create NSImage objects simply by including EPS
or TIFF data for them within the executable file, or in files inside the
application's file package.<p>
<p>

<b>Image Filtering Services</b><p>

NSImage is designed to automatically take advantage of user-installed filter
services for converting unsupported image file types to supported image file
types. The class method <b>imageFileTypes</b> returns an array of all file
types from which NSImage can create an instance of itself. This list includes
all file types supported by registered subclasses of NSImageRep, and those
types that can be converted to supported file types through a user-installed
filter service.<p>

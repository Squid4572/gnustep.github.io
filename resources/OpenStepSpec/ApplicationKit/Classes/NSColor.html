<p>
An NSColor represents a color. The color can be a grayscale value and can
include alpha (opacity) information. By sending a <b>set </b>message to an
NSColor instance, you set the color for the current PostScript drawing context.
This causes subsequently drawn graphics to have the color represented by the
NSColor instance.<p>
<p>
A color is defined in some particular <i>color space</i>. A color space
consists of a set of dimensionssuch as red, green, and blue in the case
of RGB space. Each point in the space represents a unique color, and the
point's location along each dimension is called a <i>component</i>. An
individual color is usually specified by the numeric values of its components,
which range from 0.0 to 1.0. For instance, a pure red is specified in RGB space
by the component values 1.0, 0.0, and 0.0. <p>
<p>
Some color spaces include an alpha component, which defines the color's
opacity. An alpha value of 1.0 means completely opaque, and 0.0 means
completely transparent. The alpha component is ignored when the color is used
on a device that doesn't support alpha, such as a printer.<p>
<p>
There are three kinds of color space in OpenStep:<p>
<p>
.	<i>Device-dependent</i>. This means that a given color might not look the
same on different displays and printers. <p>
<p>
.	<i>Device-independent</i>, also known as <i>calibrated. </i>With this sort of
color space, a given color should look the same on all devices.<p>
<p>
.	<i>Named</i>. The named color space has
components that aren't numeric values, but simply names in various catalogs of
colors. Named colors come with lookup tables that provide the ability to
generate the correct color on a given device.<p>
<p>
OpenStep includes six different color spaces, referred to by these enumeration
constants:<p>
<p>
  NSDeviceCMYKColorSpace	Cyan, magenta, yellow, black, and alpha components<p>
<p>
  NSDeviceWhiteColorSpace	White and alpha components<p>
<p>
  NSDeviceRGBColorSpace	Red, green, blue, and alpha components	<p>
	Hue, saturation, brightness, and alpha components<p>
<p>
  NSCalibratedWhiteColorSpace	White and alpha components<p>
<p>
  NSCalibratedRGBColorSpace	Red, green, blue, and alpha components<p>
	Hue, saturation, brightness, and alpha components<p>
<p>
  NSNamedColorSpace	Catalog name and color name components<p>
<p>
(Color spaces whose names start with NSDevice
are device-dependent; those with NSCalibrated
are device-independent.) <p>
<p>
There's usually no need to retrieve the individual components of a color, but
when needed, you can either retrieve a set of components (using such methods as
<b>getRed:green:blue:alpha:</b>) or an individual component (using such methods
as <b>redComponent</b>). However, it's illegal to ask an NSColor for components
that aren't defined for its color space. You can identify the color space by
sending a <b>colorSpaceName</b> method to the NSColor. If you need to ask an
NSColor for components that aren't in its color space (for instance, when
you've gotten the color from the color panel), first convert the color to the
appropriate color space using the <b>colorUsingColorSpaceName:</b> method.  If
the color is already in the specified color space, you get the same color back;
otherwise you get a conversion that's usually lossy or that's correct only for
the current device. You might also get back <b>nil</b> if the specified
conversion can't be done.<p>
<p>
Subclasses of NSColor need to implement the <b>colorSpaceName </b>and<b>
set</b> methods, as well as the methods that return the components for that
color space and the methods in the NSCoding protocol. Some other
methodssuch as <b>colorWithAlphaComponent:</b>, <b>isEqual:</b>, and
<b>colorUsingColorSpaceName:device:</b>may also be implemented if they
make sense for the color space. Mutable subclasses (if any) should additionally
implement <b>copyWithZone:</b> to provide a true copy.<p>

that the receiver represents. If the application is drawing to the screen
rather than printing, this method also sets the current drawing context's alpha
value to the value returned by <b>alphaComponent</b>.

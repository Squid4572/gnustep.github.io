<b>Class Description</b><p>


Instances of NSColorList are used to manage named lists of NSColors.
NSColorPanel's list-mode color picker uses instances of NSColorList to
represent any lists of colors that come with the system, as well as any lists
created by the user. An application can use NSColorList to manage
document-specific color lists, which may be added to an application's
NSColorPanel using its <b>attachColorList:</b> method.<p>
<p>
An NSColorList is similar to a dictionary object: An NSColor is added to,
looked up in, and removed from the list by specifying its key, which is an
NSString. In addition, colors can be inserted at specified positions in the
list. The list itself has a name, specified when you create the object (using
either <b>initWithName:</b> or <b>initWithName:fromFile:</b>).<p>
<p>
An NSColorList saves and retrieves its colors from files with the extension
<b>.clr</b> in directories defined by a standard
search path. To access all the color lists in the standard search path, use the
<b>availableColorLists</b> method; this returns an array of NSColorLists, from
which you can retrieve the individual color lists by name.<p>
<p>
NSColorList reads color list files in several different formats; it saves color
lists using the archiver API.<p>
<p>

<b>Initializing an NSColorList</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (id)<b>initWithName:</b>(NSString *)<i>name</i>	Initializes and returns the
receiver, registering it under the specified name if the name isn't in use
already. 
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>initWithName:</b>(NSString *)<i>name</i>	Initializes and returns the
receiver, registering it under the
<b>fromFile:</b>(NSString *)<i>path</i>		specified name if the name isn't in
use already. <i>path</i> should be the full path to the file for the color
list; <i>name</i> should be the name of the file for the color list (minus the
.clr extension). </LI></UL>
<b>Getting All Color Lists</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSArray *)<b>availableColorLists</b>	Returns an array of all NSColorLists
found in the standard color list directories. Color lists created at run time
aren't included in this list unless they're saved into one of the standard
color list directories.</LI></UL>
<b>Getting a Color List by Name</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSColorList *)<b>colorListNamed:</b>(NSString *)<i>name</i>
<i></i>	Searches the array that's returned by <b>availableColorLists</b> and
returns the NSColorList named <i>name</i>, or <b>nil</b> if no such color list
exists. <i>name</i> mustn't include the .clr
suffix.
</LI><LI> -  (NSString *)<b>name</b>	Returns the name of the NSColorList. </LI></UL>
<b>Managing Colors by Key</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSArray *)<b>allKeys</b>	Returns an array of NSString objects that contains
all the keys by which the NSColors are stored in the NSColorList. The length of
this array equals the number of colors, and its contents are arranged according
to the ordering specified when the colors were inserted.
</LI><LI> -  (NSColor *)<b>colorWithKey:</b>(NSString *)<i>key</i>	Returns the NSColor
associated with <i>key</i>, or <b>nil</b> if there is none<i>.</i>
<i></i></LI><LI> -  (void)<b>insertColor:</b>(NSColor *)<i>color</i>	Inserts <i>color</i> at the
specified location in the list (which is
<b>key:</b>(NSString *)<i>key</i>		numbered starting with 0). If the list
already contains a
<b>atIndex:</b>(unsigned)<i>location</i>		color with the same key at a
different location, it's removed from the old location. This method posts the
NSColorListChangedNotification notification to the default notification center.
Raises NSColorListNotEditableException if the color list is not editable. This
method posts the NSColorListChangedNotification notification to the default
notification center.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>removeColorWithKey:</b>(NSString *)<i>key</i>	Removes the color
associated with <i>key </i>from the list. This method does nothing if the list
doesn't contain the key. This method posts the NSColorListChangedNotification
notification to the default notification center. Raises
NSColorListNotEditableException if the color list is not editable.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>setColor:</b>(NSColor *)<i>aColor</i>	Associates the specified
NSColor with the key <i>key</i>. If the
<b>forKey:</b>(NSString *)<i>key</i>		list already contains <i>key</i>, this
method sets the corresponding color to <i>aColor</i>; otherwise, it inserts
<i>aColor</i> at the end of the list.</LI></UL>
<b>Editing</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (BOOL)<b>isEditable</b>	Returns YES if the color list can be modified. This
depends on the source of the list: If it came from a write-protected file, this
method returns NO.</LI></UL>
<b>Writing and Removing Files</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (BOOL)<b>writeToFile:</b>(NSString *)<i>path</i>	If <i>path</i> is a
directory, saves the NSColorList in a file named <i>listname</i>.clr (where
<i>listname</i> is the name with which the NSColorList was initialized). If
<i>path</i> includes a file name, this method saves the file under that name.
If <i>path</i> is <b>nil</b>, this method saves the file as <i>listname</i>.clr
in the standard location. Returns YES upon success.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>removeFile</b>	Deletes the file from which the list was created,
unless the user doesn't own the color list. The receiver is removed from the
list of available colors, but isn't released.

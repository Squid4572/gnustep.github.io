<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSObject is the root class of all ordinary Objective C inheritance hierarchies;
it has no superclass. Its interface derives from two sources: the methods it
declares directly and those declared in the NSObject protocol. Its interface is
divided in this way so that objects inheriting from other root classes (notably
NSProxy) can stand in for ordinary objects without having to inherit from
NSObject. The following discussion makes no distinction between the methods
declared in this class and those declared in the NSObject protocol. <p>
<p>
From NSObject, other classes inherit a basic interface to the run-time system
for the Objective C language. It's through NSObject that instances of all
classes obtain their ability to behave as objects. Among other things, the
NSObject class provides inheriting classes with a framework for creating,
initializing, deallocating, comparing, and archiving objects, for performing
methods selected at run-time, for querying an object about its methods and its
position in the inheritance hierarchy, and for forwarding messages to other
objects. For example, to ask an object what class it belongs to, you'd send it
a <b>class</b> message. To find out whether it implements a particular method,
you'd send it a <b>respondsToSelector:</b> message<p>
<p>
The NSObject class is an abstract class; programs use instances of classes that
inherit from NSObject, but never of NSObject itself.<p>
<p>

<b>Initializing an Object to Its Class</b><p>

Every object is connected to the run-time system through its <b>isa</b>
instance variable, inherited from the NSObject class. <b>isa</b> identifies the
object's class; it points to a structure that's compiled from the class
definition. Through <b>isa</b>, an object can find whatever information it
needs at run timesuch as its place in the inheritance hierarchy, the
size and structure of its instance variables, and the location of the method
implementations it can perform in response to messages.<p>
<p>
Because all ordinary objects inherit directly or indirectly from the NSObject
class, they all have this variable. The defining characteristic of an
object is that its first instance variable is an
<b>isa</b> pointer to a class structure.<p>
<p>
The installation of the class structurethe initialization of
<b>isa</b>is one of the responsibilities of the <b>alloc</b> and
<b>allocWithZone:</b> methods, the same methods that create (allocate memory
for) new instances of a class. In other words, class initialization is part of
the process of creating an object; it's not left to the methods, such as
<b>init</b>, that initialize individual objects with their particular
characteristics.<p>
<p>

<b>Instance and Class Methods</b><p>

Every object requires an interface to the run-time system, whether it's an
instance object or a class object. For example, it should be possible to ask
either an instance or a class whether it can respond to a particular message.
So that this won't mean implementing every NSObject method twice, once as an
instance method and again as a class method, the run-time system treats methods
defined in the root class in a special way:<p>
<p>
<i>Instance methods defined in the root class can be performed both by
instances</i><p>
<i>and by class objects.</i> <p>
<p>
A class object has access to class methodsthose defined in the class and
those inherited from the classes above it in the inheritance
hierarchybut generally not to instance methods. However, the run-time
system gives all class objects access to the instance methods defined in the
root class. Any class object can perform any root instance method, provided it
doesn't have a class method with the same name.<p>
<p>
For example, a class object could be sent messages to perform NSObject's
<b>respondsToSelector:</b> and <b>perform:withObject:</b> instance methods:<p>
<p>
<tt>SEL method = @selector(riskAll:);</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>if ( [MyClass respondsToSelector:method] )</tt><p>
<tt>    [MyClass perform:method withObject:self];</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
When a class object receives a message, the run-time system looks first at the
receiver's set of class methods. If it fails to find a class method that can
respond to the message, it looks at the set of instance methods defined in the
root class. If the root class has an instance method that can respond (as
NSObject does for <b>respondsToSelector:</b> and <b>perform:withObject:</b>),
the run-time system uses that implementation and the message succeeds.<p>
<p>
Note that the only instance methods available to a class object are those
defined in the root class. If MyClass in the example above had reimplemented
either <b>respondsToSelector:</b> or <b>perform:withObject:</b>, those new
versions of the methods would be available only to instances. The class object
for MyClass could perform only the versions defined in the NSObject class. (Of
course, if MyClass had implemented <b>respondsToSelector:</b> or
<b>perform:withObject:</b> as class methods rather than instance methods, the
class would perform those new versions.)<p>
<p>

<b>Initializing the Class</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (void)<b>initialize</b>	Initializes the class before it's used (before it
receives its first message). </LI></UL>
<b>Creating and Destroying Instances</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (id)<b>alloc</b>	Returns a new, uninitialized instance of the receiving
class. 
</LI><LI> +  (id)<b>allocWithZone:</b>(NSZone *)<i>zone</i>	Returns a new, uninitialized
instance of the receiving class in <i>zone</i>.
</LI><LI> +  (id)<b>new</b>	Allocates a new instance of the receiving class, sends it an
<b>init</b> message, and returns the initialized object returned by
<b>init</b>. This method is simply a convenient cover for the <b>alloc</b> and
<b>init</b> methods.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>copy</b>	Invokes <b>copyWithZone:</b>. This method is implemented in
NSObject as a convenience to subclasses. A subclass need override only
<b>copyWithZone:</b> for both <b>copy</b> and <b>copyWithZone:</b> to operate
correctly.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>dealloc</b>	Deallocates the memory occupied by the receiver. 
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>init</b>	Implemented by subclasses to initialize a new object (the
receiver) immediately after memory for it has been allocated.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>mutableCopy</b>	Invokes <b>mutableCopyWithZone:</b>.  This method is
implemented in NSObject as a convenience to subclasses. A subclass need
override only <b>mutableCopyWithZone:</b> for both <b>mutableCopy</b> and
<b>mutableCopyWithZone:</b> to operate correctly.</LI></UL>
<b>Identifying Classes</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (Class)<b>class</b>	Returns <b>self</b>. Since this is a class method, it
returns the class object.
</LI><LI> +  (Class)<b>superclass</b>	Returns the class object for the receiver's
superclass.</LI></UL>
<b>Testing Class Functionality</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (BOOL)<b>instancesRespondToSelector:</b>(SEL)<i>aSelector</i>
<i></i>	Returns YES if instances of the class are capable of responding to
<i>aSelector</i> messages, and NO if they're not.</LI></UL>
<b>Testing Protocol Conformance</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (BOOL)<b>conformsToProtocol:</b>(Protocol *)<i>aProtocol</i>

if it doesn't.</LI></UL>
<b>Obtaining Method Information</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (IMP)<b>instanceMethodForSelector:</b>(SEL)<i>aSelector</i>

<i>aSelector</i> instance method.
</LI><LI> -  (IMP)<b>methodForSelector:</b>(SEL)<i>aSelector</i>	Locates and returns the
address of the receiver's implementation of the <i>aSelector</i> method, so
that it can be called as a function.
</LI><LI> -  (NSMethodSignature
*)<b>methodSignatureForSelector:</b>(SEL)<i>aSelector</i>
<i></i>	Returns an object that contains a description of the <i>aSelector</i>
method, or <b>nil</b> if the <i>aSelector</i> method can't be found.</LI></UL>
<b>Describing Objects</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSString *)<b>description</b>	Subclasses override this method to return a
human-readable string representation of the contents of the receiver.
NSObject's implementation simply prints the name of the receiver's class.</LI></UL>
<b>Posing</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (void)<b>poseAsClass:</b>(Class)<i>aClass</i>	Causes the receiving class to
pose as its superclass.</LI></UL>

</LI></UL>
<b>Sending Deferred Messages</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (void)<b>cancelPreviousPerformRequestsWithTarget:</b>(id)<i>aTarget</i>
<i></i>selector:(SEL)<i>aSelector</i>	Cancels previous perform requests having
the same target
<b>object:</b>(id)<i>anObject		</i>and argument (as determined by
<b>isEqual:</b>), and the same selector. This method removes timers only in the
current run loop, not all run loops.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>performSelector:</b>(SEL)<i>aSelector</i>	Sends an <i>aSelector</i>
message to <i>anObject</i> after <i>delay</i>.  <b>self</b>

archiving. NSObject's implementation returns the object returned by<b>
classForCoder:</b>.
</LI><LI> -  (Class)<b>classForCoder</b>	Identifies the class to be used during
serialization. An NSObject returns its own class by default.

<p>
An NSCustomImageRep is an object that uses a delegated method to render an
image. When called upon to produce the image, it sends a message to its
delegate to have the method performed.<p>
<p>
Like most other kinds of NSImageReps, an NSCustomImageRep is generally used
indirectly, through an NSImage object. An NSImage must be able to choose
between various representations of a given image. It also needs to provide an
off-screen cache of the appropriate depth for any image it uses. It determines
this information by querying its NSImageReps.<p>
<p>
Thus to work with an NSImage, an NSCustomImageRep must be able to provide some
information about its image. Use the following methods, inherited from the
NSImageRep class, to set these attributes of the NSCustomImageRep:<p>
<p>
setSize:<p>
setColorSpaceName:<p>
setAlpha:<p>
setPixelsHigh:<p>
setPixelsWide:<p>
setBitsPerSample:<p>

<b>Initializing a New NSCustomImageRep </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (id)<b>initWithDrawSelector:</b>(SEL)<i>aSelector</i>	Initializes a new
instance so that it delegates the 
<b>delegate:</b>(id)<i>anObject</i>		responsibility for drawing to
<i>anObject</i>. When<i> </i>the NSCustomImageRep receives a <b>draw</b>
message, it sends an <i>aSelector</i> message to <i>anObject</i>.</LI></UL>
<b>Identifying the Object </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (id)<b>delegate	</b>Returns the delegate.
</LI><LI> -  (SEL)<b>drawSelector</b>	Returns the associated draw method selector.

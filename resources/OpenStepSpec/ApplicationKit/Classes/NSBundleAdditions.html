<b>NSBundle Additions</b><p>

<B>Inherits From: </B><A HREF="NSObject.html">NSObject</A><p>
<p>
<b>Declared In:	</b>AppKit/NSImage.h <p>
AppKit/NSNibLoading.h<p>
<p>

<b>Class Description</b><p>


The Application Kit adds these methods to the Foundation Kit's NSBundle class.
These methods become part of the class for all applications that use the
Application Kit, but not for applications that don't.<p>
<p>

<b>Getting the Location of Images in the File System</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSString *)<b>pathForImageResource:</b>(NSString *)<i>name</i>
<i></i>	Returns the absolute pathname of the file containing the specified
image resource. (The<i> name</i> of the resource is simply the filename without
the path of its bundle directory; the filename extension need not be
included.)</LI></UL>
<b>Loading an Interface Builder File</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (BOOL)<b>loadNibFile:</b>(NSString *)<i>fileName</i> 	Unarchives the contents
of the nib file whose absolute path
<b>externalNameTable:</b>(NSDictionary *)<i>context</i> 	is <i>fileName</i>.
Objects from the nib file are allocated in
<b>withZone:</b>(NSZone *)<i>zone</i>		 the specified zone of memory. The
<i>context</i> argument is a name tablea dictionary whose keys are names
like NSOwner and whose values are existing
objects that can be referenced by the newly unarchived objects. Returns YES
upon success. (A nib file is a object archive whose file format is currently
implementation specific. A public specification of this file format will be
available at a later date.)
</LI><LI> +  (BOOL)<b>loadNibNamed:</b>(NSString *)<i>aNibName</i> 	Similar to
<b>loadNibFile:externalNameTable:withZone:</b>,
<b>owner:</b>(id)<i>owner</i>		but the name table's only element is the
specified owner (stored with the key NSOwner).
Objects from the nib file are allocated in <i>owner</i>'s zone. If there's a
bundle for <i>owner</i>'s class, this method looks in that bundle for the nib
file<i> </i>named <i>aNibName</i> (this argument need not include the
.nib extension); otherwise, it looks in the main
bundle. (A nib file is a object archive whose file format is currently
implementation specific. A public specification of this file format will be
available at a later date.)

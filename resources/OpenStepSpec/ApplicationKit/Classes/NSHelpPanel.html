<b>Class Description</b><p>


The NSHelpPanel class is the central component of the OpenStep help system. It
provides the Help panel that displays the text and illustrations that
constitute your application's help information. The NSHelpPanel class object
itself stores the table of associations between an application's user-interface
objects and specific passages of the help text.<p>
<p>
Users can display the Help panel by choosing the Help command from an
application's Info menu. The panel employs the metaphor of a book: It displays
a table of contents, body text, and an index. Users can browse through the text
by clicking entries in the table of contents or index. The panel also supports
hypertext-like help links, which appear as diamond-shaped images within the
text and allow the user to easily follow cross references. By using the help
cursor and clicking user-interface objects, the user can query the Help panel
for information associated with those objects. <p>
<p>

<b>The Help Text</b><p>

An NSHelpPanel object looks in a language-specific directory within the
application's file package for the text that it will display. (Some
implementations may employ more efficient means of storage than files and
directories.) For example, if the user's language preference is English, the
panel searches for a directory named <b>Help</b> within the
<b>English.lproj</b> directory of the application's file package. It searches
for two files: <b>TableOfContents.rtf</b> and <b>Index.rtfd</b>. There may also
be one or more files containing the body text that the Help panel will display.
The table-of-contents, index, and body files are interconnected by<i> </i>a
system of <i>help links</i> and <i>help markers</i>.<p>
<p>
A help marker is a named position holder in the stream of textin most
cases, it's invisible to users. A help link is a diamond-shaped button embedded
in the text. Help links store a file name and, optionally, a help marker name.
When a user clicks a help link, the Help panel displays the named file. If the
help link also stores a marker name, the displayed file is scrolled to the
position of the marker, and the text is selected from the marker's position to
the end of the line.<p>
<p>

<b>Table-of-Contents and Index Files</b><p>

The table-of-contents and index files are specially designed documents in Rich
Text Format (RTF). An NSHelpPanel object identifies these files by name
(<b>TableOfContents.rtf</b> and <b>Index.rtfd</b>) and processes them
differently than it does other help files.<p>
<p>
The table-of-contents file should contain one entry for each help text file in
the help directory. Each entry begins with a help link that stores the name of
the destination file for that entry. Following the link is the text of the
entry, which may wrap and span several lines. Although the table of contents in
the Help panel looks like it's displayed by an NSMatrix, it's actually
displayed by a modified NSText object. Thus, you can use the full generality of
RTF to format your table of contents.<p>
<p>
The index file is structured similarly although there is no enforced one-to-one
mapping. Generally, the help link that begins an index entry stores both a file
name and a marker name, since an index entry usually points to a specific word
or phrase within a file.<p>
<p>

<b>Generic Help Files</b><p>

An application's Help directory can contain only table-of-contents and index
files, and yet the application may be able to display numerous help subjects,
each of a general nature. This is because OpenStep applications have access to
generic help files contained in a directory found in a system-specific
location. <p>
<p>
When a help link is being resolved, the NSHelpPanel first looks for the
specified file within the appropriate <i>language</i>.lproj/Help directory of
the application's file package. If the file isn't found, it then searches the
directory of generic help files. This search path is used for all links,
whether they are in the table of contents, index, or body text.<p>
<p>
If one of these generic help files is inappropriate for your application, you
have two remedies: You can remove the table-of-contents and index entries that
refer to it, or you can override the file with one that's more appropriate. By
placing a file of the same name and relative location within your application's
<b>Help</b> directory, NSHelpPanel will display it rather than the generic
file.<p>
<p>

<b>Associating Help Text with Objects</b><p>

The NSHelpPanel class stores associations between user-interface objects and
help text. When the user presses the Help modifier key (which varies depending
on the hardware running the application), a question mark cursor appears. If
the user clicks an object using this cursor, the Help panel displays the
associated help text.<p>
<p>
You can attach a help file to a user-interface object programmatically, by
sending an <b>attachHelpFile:markerName:to: </b>message<b> </b>to the
NSHelpPanel class object. This method takes a file name, a marker name, and an
object <b>id</b> as its arguments. The <b>detachHelpFrom:</b> message removes
such an association.<p>
<p>
Just as with help links, an NSHelpPanel searches both the application's file
package and the generic help files in attempting to find the file associated
with a particular user-interface object.<p>
<p>

<b>Hidden Files</b><p>

Although in general there's a one-to-one relationship between table-of-contents
entries and files in the <b>Help</b> directory, you can force a single
table-of-contents entry to represent multiple
hidden files. This can be useful in reducing the
overall length of the table of contents.<p>
<p>
Hidden files can't be accessed from the table of contents; rather, the user
must find them by Help-clicking an object in the application's user interface,
by using the Help Panel's Find command, by using the index, or by following a
help link from some other file. However, when a hidden file is displayed, the
Help panel must select some entry in the table of contents.<p>
<p>
Conversely, when the user selects such a table-of-contents entry, the Help
panel must display one of the files in the directory of hidden files; by
convention, this file must be named <b>Prolog.rtfd</b>. The prolog file
typically informs users that they can get help on a particular user-interface
object by Help-clicking that object.<p>
<p>
The Help panel's Find button searches through all the files that are connected
to table-of-contents entries, first looking in the application's <b>Help</b>
directory and then in the generic help material. If you don't want some hidden
file in the generic help material to appear in your application's Help panel as
the result of a Find operation, override the file with an empty file of the
same name. Since the file is empty, no search string will ever be found in it,
and it will effectively block the generic file of the same name from being
searched. <p>
<p>

<b>Searching the Help Text</b><p>

By clicking the Help panel's Find button, users can search the help text for
strings. NSHelpPanel uses two approaches to locate text containing a specific
string. First, it attempts to find the string in the currently displayed help
text by sending the object that displays the text (an instance of
NSCStringText) a <b>findText:ignoreCase:backwards:wrap:</b> message. If the
search is unsuccessful, or if the search is continued past the last occurrence
of the string in the current file, the NSHelpPanel object scans for the string
in other help files, both within the application's help files and within the
generic help files. Some implementations of NSHelpPanel may make use of a
previously built index of all the help text to speed this search.<p>
<p>

<b>Help Supplements</b><p>

Since in OpenStep an application may load executable modules dynamically (for
example, a drawing program could allow the user to load a new drawing tool), an
NSHelpPanel object provides the ability to load supplemental help information.
When the application loads the module, it sends the NSHelpPanel object an
<b>addSupplement:inPath:</b> message to inform the object of the location of
the new help supplement. The NSHelpPanel object appends the contents of the
supplement's <b>TableOfContents.rtf</b> to the existing table of contents, so
the supplement should have a title that clearly sets it off from the main part
of the table of contents, for example: <p>
<p>
<b>Pattern Tool Supplement</b><p>

<b>Pattern Options</b><p>
<b></b>	Brick<p>
	Stucco<p>
	Wood<p>
	Tile<p>
	Custom<p>
<b>Resizing and Rotating</b><p>
<b>Blending Patterns</b><p>
<b>Index to Supplement</b><p>

The supplement's index is only accessible from the table of contents; the Help
panel's Index button displays only the main index.<p>
<p>

<b>Accessing the Help Panel</b><p>

NSHelpPanel object. 
</LI><LI> +  (NSHelpPanel *)<b>sharedHelpPanelWithDirectory:</b>(NSString

<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSPasteboard objects transfer data to and from the pasteboard server. The
server is shared by all running applications. It contains data that the user
has cut or copied and may paste, as well as other data that one application
wants to transfer to another. NSPasteboard objects are an application's sole
interface to the server and to all pasteboard operations.<p>
<p>

<b>Named Pasteboards</b><p>

Data in the pasteboard server is associated with a name that indicates how it's
to be used. Each set of data and its associated name is, in effect, a separate
pasteboard, distinct from the others. An application keeps a separate
NSPasteboard object for each named pasteboard that it uses. There are five
standard pasteboards in common use:<p>
<p>
General pasteboard	The pasteboard that's used for ordinary cut, copy, and paste
operations. It holds the contents of the last selection that's been cut or
copied.<p>
<p>
Font pasteboard	The pasteboard that holds font and character information and
supports the Copy Font and Paste Font commands.<p>
<p>
Ruler pasteboard	The pasteboard that holds information about paragraph formats
in support of the Copy Ruler and Paste Ruler commands.<p>
<p>
Find pasteboard	The pasteboard that holds information about the current state
of the active application's Find panel. This information permits users to enter
a search string into the Find panel, then switch to another application to
conduct the search.<p>
<p>
Drag pasteboard	The pasteboard that stores data to be manipulated as the result
of a drag operation.<p>
<p>
Each standard pasteboard is identified by a unique name (stored in global
string objects):<p>
<p>
NSGeneralPboard<p>
NSFontPboard<p>
NSRulerPboard<p>
NSFindPboard<p>
NSDragPboard<p>
<p>
<p>
You can create private pasteboards by asking for an NSPasteboard object with
any name other than those listed above. The name of a private pasteboard can be
passed to other applications to allow them to share the data it holds.<p>
<p>
The NSPasteboard class makes sure there's never more than one object for each
named pasteboard. If you ask for a new object when one has already been created
for the pasteboard with that name, the existing object will be returned to
you.<p>
<p>

<b>Data Types</b><p>

Data can be placed in the pasteboard server in more than one representation.
For example, an image might be provided both in Tag Image File Format (TIFF)
and as encapsulated PostScript code (EPS). Multiple representations give
pasting applications the option of choosing which data type to use. In general,
an application taking data from the pasteboard should choose the richest
representation it can handlerich text over plain ASCII, for example. An
application putting data in the pasteboard should promise to supply it in as
many data types as possible, so that as many applications as possible can make
use of it.<p>
<p>
Data types are identified by string objects containing the full type name.
These global variables identify the string objects for the standard pasteboard
types:<p>
<p>
<b>Type	Description</b><p>

<b></b>NSStringPboardType	NSString data<p>
NSPostScriptPboardType	Encapsulated PostScript code (EPS)<p>
NSTIFFPboardType	Tag Image File Format (TIFF)<p>
NSRTFPboardType	Rich Text Format (RTF)<p>
NSFilenamesPboardType	ASCII text designating one or more file names <p>
NSTabularTextPboardType	Tab-separated fields of ASCII text<p>
NSFontPboardType	Font and character information<p>
NSRulerPboardType	Paragraph formatting information<p>
NSFileContentsPboardType	A representation of a file's contents<p>
NSColorPboardType	NSColor data<p>
NSGeneralPboardType	Describes a selection<p>
NSDataLinkPboardType	Defines a link between documents<p>
<p>
<p>
Types other than those listed can also be used. For example, your application
may keep data in a private format that's richer than any of the types listed
above. That format can also be used as a pasteboard type.<p>
<p>

<b>Reading and Writing Data</b><p>

Typically, data is written to the pasteboard using <b>setData:forType:</b> and
read using <b>dataForType:</b>. However, data of the type
NSFileContentsPboardType, representing the contents of a named file, must be
written to the NSPasteboard object using <b>writeFileContents:</b> and copied
from the object to a file using <b>readFileContentsType:toFile:</b>. <p>
<p>

<b>Errors</b><p>

Except where errors are specifically mentioned in the method descriptions, any
communications error with the pasteboard server raises an
NSPasteboardCommunicationException exception.<p>

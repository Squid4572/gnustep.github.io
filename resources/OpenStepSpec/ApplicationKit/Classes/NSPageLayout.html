<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSPageLayout is a type of NSPanel that queries the user for information such as
paper type and orientation. This information is stored in an NSPrintInfo
object, and is later used when printing. The NSPageLayout panel is created,
displayed, and run (in a modal loop) when a <b>runPageLayout:</b> message is
sent to the NSApplication object. By default, this message is sent up the
responder chain when the user clicks the Page Layout menu item.<p>
<p>
Typically, you access an NSPageLayout panel by invoking the <b>pageLayout</b>
method. When the class receives a <b>pageLayout</b> message, it tries to reuse
an existing panel rather than create a new one. If a panel is reused, its
attributes are reset to the default values so that the effect is the same as
receiving a new panel. Because Page Layout panels may be reused, you shouldn't
modify the instance returned by <b>pageLayout</b>, except through the methods
listed below. If you must modify the Page Layout panel in other ways than those
allowed by its methods, create and manage your own instance using the
<b>alloc...</b> and <b>init...</b> methods rather than the <b>pageLayout</b>
method.<p>
<p>
You can add your own controls to the Page Layout panel through the
<b>setAccessoryView:</b> method. The panel is automatically resized to
accommodate the NSView that you've added. Note that you can't retrieve the
NSPageLayout's settings through messages to the page layout panel
objectNSPageLayout does not have accessor methods to obtain the state of
its controls. If controls you add through an accessory view need to know the
values of the existing controls in the page layout panel (or vice versa),
access NSPageLayout's controls using the tags defined in AppKit/NSPageLayout.h
as arguments to <b>viewWithTag:</b> messages to the page layout panel object.
Controls thus returned can then be queried for their state.<p>

<b>Creating an NSPageLayout Instance </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSPageLayout *)<b>pageLayout</b>	Returns a default NSPageLayout object.</LI></UL>
<b>Running the Panel </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (int)<b>runModal</b>	Displays the panel and begins its event loop. The
panel's values are recorded in the shared NSPrintInfo object.
</LI><LI> -  (int)<b>runModalWithPrintInfo:</b>(NSPrintInfo *)<i>pInfo	</i>
<i></i>	Displays the panel and begins its event loop<i>. </i>The panel's values
are recorded in the <i>pInfo</i>, the supplied NSPrintInfo object.</LI></UL>
<b>Customizing the Panel </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSView *)<b>accessoryView</b>	Returns the NSPageLayout's accessory View.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>setAccessoryView:</b>(NSView *)<i>aView</i>	Adds a View to the
panel.</LI></UL>
<b>Updating the Panel's Display </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>convertOldFactor:</b>(float *)<i>old</i>	 Returns by reference the
ratio between a point and the
<b>newFactor:</b>(float *)<i>new</i>	 	currently chosen unit of measurement. If
invoked within the <b>pickedUnits:</b> method, <i>old</i> refers to the ratio
before the user's choice and <i>new</i> refers to the new ratio.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>pickedButton:</b>(id)<i>sender</i>	Stops the event loop.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>pickedOrientation:</b>(id)<i>sender</i>	Updates the panel with the
selected orientation.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>pickedPaperSize:</b>(id)<i>sender</i>	Updates the panel when a paper
size is selected.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>pickedUnits:</b>(id)<i>sender</i>	Updates the panel when a new unit
is selected.</LI></UL>
<b>Communicating with the NSPrintInfo Object </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSPrintInfo *)<b>printInfo	</b>Returns the NSPrintInfo object that used when
the panel is run.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>readPrintInfo</b>	Reads the NSPageLayout's values from the
NSPrintInfo object.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>writePrintInfo</b>	Writes the NSPageLayout's values to the
NSPrintInfo object.

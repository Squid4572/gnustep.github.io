<b>Class Description</b><p>


The NSPanel class defines objects that manage the panels of the OpenStep user
interface. A panel is a window that serves an auxiliary function within an
application. It generally displays controls that the user can act on to give
instructions to the application or to modify the contents of a standard
window.<p>
<p>
Panels behave differently from standard windows in only a small number of ways,
but the ways are important to the user interface:<p>
<p>
.	Panels can assume key windowbut not main windowstatus. (The key
window receives keyboard events. The main window is the primary focus of user
actions; it might contain the document the user is working on, for example.)<p>
<p>
.	On-screen panels are normally removed from the screen list when the user
begins to work in another application, and are restored to the screen when the
user returns to the panel's application.<p>
<p>
To aid in their auxiliary role, panels can be assigned special behaviors:<p>
<p>
.	A panel can be precluded from becoming the key window until the user makes a
selection (makes some view in the panel the first responder) indicating an
intention to begin typing. This prevents key window status from shifting to the
panel unnecessarily.<p>
<p>
.	Palettes and similar panels can be made to float above standard windows and
other panels. This prevents them from being covered and keeps them readily
available to the user.<p>
<p>
.	A panel can be made to workto receive mouse and keyboard
eventseven when there's an attention panel on-screen. This permits
actions within the panel to affect the attention panel.<p>

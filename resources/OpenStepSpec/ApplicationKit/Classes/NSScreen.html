<b>Class Description</b><p>


An NSScreen object describes the attributes of a computer's monitor, or screen.
An application may use an NSScreen object to retrieve information about a
screen and use this information to decide what to display upon that screen. For
example, an application may use the <b>deepestScreen</b> method to find out
which of the available screens can best represent color and then may choose to
display all of its windows on that screen. <p>
<p>
The two main attributes of a screen are its depth and its dimensions. The
<b>depth</b> method describes the screen depth (such as two-bit, eight-bit, or
twelve-bit) and tells you if the screen can display color. The <b>frame</b>
method gives the screen's dimensions and location as an NSRect. <p>
<p>
The device description dictionary contains more complete information about the
screen. Use NSScreen's <b>deviceDescription</b> method to access the
dictionary, and use these keys to retrieve information about a screen:<p>
<p>
<b>Dictionary Key	Returns</b><p>

<b></b>NSDeviceResolution	An NSValue describing the screen's resolution in dots
per inch (dpi).<p>
<p>
NSDeviceColorSpaceName	The screen's color space name. See NSGraphics.h for a
list of possible values.<p>
<p>
NSDeviceBitsPerSample	The bit depth of screen images (2-bit, 8-bit, etc.). <p>
<p>
NSDeviceIsScreen	YES, indicating the device is a screen.<p>
<p>
NSDeviceSize	An NSValue describing the screen's size in points.<p>
<p>
<p>
The device description dictionary contains information about not only screens,
but all other system devices such as printers and windows. There are other keys
into the dictionary that you would use to obtain information about these other
devices. For a complete list of device dictionary keys, see NSGraphics.h.<p>

<b>Creating NSScreen Instances</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSScreen *)<b>mainScreen</b>	Returns an NSScreen object representing the
main screen. The main screen is the screen with the key window.
</LI><LI> +  (NSScreen *)<b>deepestScreen</b>	Returns an NSScreen object representing the
screen that can best represent color. This method always returns an object,
even if there is only one screen and it is not a color screen. 
</LI><LI> +  (NSArray *)<b>screens</b>	Returns an array of NSScreen objects representing
all of the screens available on the system. Raises
NSWindowServerCommunicationException if the screens information can't be
obtained from the window system.</LI></UL>
<b>Reading Screen Information</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSWindowDepth)<b>depth	</b>Returns the screen's depth, including whether the
screen can display color.
</LI><LI> -  (NSRect)<b>frame</b>	Returns the dimensions and location of the screen in an
NSRect.
</LI><LI> -  (NSDictionary *)<b>deviceDescription</b>	Returns the device dictionary as

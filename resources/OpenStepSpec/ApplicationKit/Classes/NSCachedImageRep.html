<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSCachedImageRep, a subclass of NSImageRep, defines an object that stores its
source data as a rendered image in a window, typically a window that stays
off-screen. The only data that's available for reproducing the image is the
image itself. Thus an NSCachedImageRep differs from the other kinds of
NSImageReps defined in the Application Kit, all of which can reproduce an image
from the information originally used to draw it. Instances of this class are
generally used indirectly, through an NSImage object. <p>

<b>Initializing an NSCachedImageRep </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (id)<b>initWithSize:</b>(NSSize)<i>aSize</i> 	Initializes a new
NSCachedImageRep for an image of the
<b>depth:</b>(NSWindowDepth)<i>aDepth</i> 		specified size and depth. The
<i>separate</i> argument
<b>separate:</b>(BOOL)<i>separate</i> 		specifies whether the image will get
its own unique
<b>alpha:</b>(BOOL)<i>alpha</i>		cache, instead of possibly sharing one with
other images. For best performance (although it's not essential), the
<i>alpha</i> argument should be set according to whether the image will have a
channel for transparency information.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>initWithWindow:</b>(NSWindow *)<i>aWindow</i>	Initializes the new
NSCachedImageRep for an image to be
<b>rect:</b>(NSRect)<i>aRect</i>		drawn in the rectangle <i>aRect</i> of the
specified window. This method retains <i>aWindow</i>.</LI></UL>
<b>Getting the Representation </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSRect)<b>rect</b>	Returns the rectangle where the image is cached. 
</LI><LI> -  (NSWindow *)<b>window</b>	Returns the NSWindow where the image is cached.

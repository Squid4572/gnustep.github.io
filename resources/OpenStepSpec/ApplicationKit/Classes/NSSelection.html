<b>Class Description</b><p>


The NSSelection class defines an object that describes a selection within a
document. An NSSelection, or simply, selection, is an immutable description; it
may be held by the system or other documents, and it cannot change over time.
Selections are typically used by NSDataLink objects to represent the source and
destination of a link.<p>
<p>
Because a selection description can't be changed once it's been exported, it's
a good idea to construct general descriptions that can survive changes to a
document and don't require selection-specific information to be stored in the
document. This description may be simple or complex, depending upon the
application. For example, a painting application might describe a selection in
an image as a simple rectangle. This description doesn't require that any
information be stored in the image's file, and the description can be expected
to remain valid through the life of the image. An object-based drawing
application might describe a selection as a list of object identifiers (though
<i>not</i> <b>id</b>s), where an object identifier is unique throughout the
life of the document. Based on this list, a selection could be meaningfully
reconstructed, even if new objects are added to the document or selected
objects are deleted. Such a scheme doesn't require that any selection-specific
information be stored in the document's file, with the benefit that links can
be made to read-only documents. <p>
<p>
Maintaining a character-range selection in a text document is more problematic.
A possible solution is to insert selection-begin and selection-end markers that
define a specific selection into the text stream. A selection description would
then refer to a specific selection marker. This solution requires that
selection state information be stored and maintained within the document.
Furthermore, this information generally shouldn't be purged from the document,
because the document can't know how many references to the selection exist.
(References to the selection could be stored with documents on removable media,
like floppy disks.) This selection-state information should be maintained as
long as it refers to any meaningful data. For this reason, it's desirable to
describe selection in a manner that doesn't require that selection-state
information be maintained in the document whenever possible.<p>
<p>
Three well-known selection descriptions can apply to any document: the empty
selection, the entire document, and the abstract concept of the current
selection. NSSelection objects for these selections are returned by the
<b>emptySelection</b>,<b> allSelection</b>, and <b>currentSelection</b> class
methods.<p>
<p>
Since an NSSelection may be used in a document that is read by machines with
different architectures, care should be taken to write machine-independent
descriptions. For example, using a binary structure as a selection description
will fail on a machine where an identically defined structure has a different
size or is kept in memory with different byte ordering. Exporting (and then
parsing) ASCII descriptions is often a good solution. If binary descriptions
must be used, it's prudent to preface the description with a token specifying
the description's byte ordering.<p>
<p>
It may also be prudent to version-stamp selection descriptions, so that old
selections can be accurately read by updated versions of an application.<p>

<b>Returning Special Selection Shared Instances</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSSelection *)<b>allSelection</b>	Returns the shared instance of the
well-known selection representing the entire document.
</LI><LI> +  (NSSelection *)<b>currentSelection</b>	Returns the shared instance of the
well-known selection representing the abstract concept of the current
selection. The current selection never describes a specific selection; it
describes a selection that may change frequently.
</LI><LI> +  (NSSelection *)<b>emptySelection</b>	Returns the shared instance of the
well-known selection representing no data.</LI></UL>
<b>Creating and Initializing a Selection</b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSSelection *)<b>selectionWithDescriptionData:</b>(NSData *)<i>data</i>	
	Creates and returns an NSSelection object that records <i>data</i> as the
description of the selection.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>initWithDescriptionData:</b>(NSData *)<i>newData</i>	Initializes a
newly allocated NSSelection object that records <i>data</i> as the description
of the selection. Returns the initialized object.
</LI><LI> -  (id)<b>initWithPasteboard:</b>(NSPasteboard *)<i>pasteboard</i>	
	Initializes a newly allocated NSSelection object that takes its description of
the selection from <i>pasteboard</i>. Returns the initialized object.</LI></UL>
<b>Describing a Selection</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (NSData *)<b>descriptionData</b>	Returns the data that describes the
selection as set by <b>selectionWithDescriptionData:</b> or
<b>initWithDescriptionData:</b>.
</LI><LI> -  (BOOL)<b>isWellKnownSelection</b>	Returns YES if the receiver is one of the
well-known selection types (those representing the entire document, current
selection, or empty selection) and NO otherwise.</LI></UL>
<b>Writing a Selection to the Pasteboard</b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>writeToPasteboard:</b>(NSPasteboard *)<i>pasteboard</i>	
	Writes the selection data to the pasteboard <i>pasteboard</i>. A copy of the
selection can then be retrieved by initializing a new NSSelection from the
pasteboard using <b>initWithPasteboard:</b>.

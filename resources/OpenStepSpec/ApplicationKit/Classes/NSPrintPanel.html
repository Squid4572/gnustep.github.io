<b>Class Description</b><p>


NSPrintPanel creates a Print panel. The Print panel queries the user for
information about a print job, such as which pages to print and how many
copies. <p>
<p>
When a <b>print:</b> message is sent to an NSView or NSWindow, an
NSPrintOperation object is created to control the print operation, which
includes deciding whether or not to use an NSPrintPanel. The NSPrintPanel will
be used unless the <b>setShowPanels:NO</b> message is sent to the
NSPrintOperation. If you're subclassing NSPrintPanel, send the
<b>setPrintPanel</b> message to the NSPrintOperation object to ensure that an
instance of your subclass is the unique NSPrintPanel for that operation.<p>
<p>
Short of subclassing NSPrintPanel, you can augment its display by adding a
custom NSView through the <b>setAccessoryView:</b> method. The panel is
automatically resized to accommodate the NSView that you add. Note, however,
that you don't have to create controls for special printer features. If a
printer includes features in the OpenUI field of
its PostScript Printer Description (PPD) table, these features will be
displayed in a separate panel that's brought up when the user clicks the Print
panel's Options button. For more information on a printer's PPD table, see the
NSPrinter class description.<p>
<p>
Typically, you access an NSPrintPanel by invoking the <b>printPanel</b> method.
When the class receives a <b>printPanel</b> message, it tries to reuse an
existing panel rather than create a new one. When a panel is reused, its
attributes are reset to the default values so that the effect is the same as
receiving a new panel. Because a Print panel may be reused, you shouldn't
modify the instance returned by <b>printPanel</b>, except through the methods
listed below. For example, you can set the accessory view, but not the
arrangement of the buttons within the panel. If you must modify the Print panel
substantially, create and manage your own instance using the <b>alloc...</b>
and <b>init...</b> methods rather than the <b>printPanel</b> method.<p>
<p>
An application stores printing information in an NSPrintInfo object.
NSPrintPanel's <b>updateFromPrintInfo</b> reads the NSPrintInfo object's
information into the Print panel. <b>finalWritePrintInfo</b> updates the
NSPrintInfo object if the user changes the information on the Print panel. When
the NSPrintOperation object is created, an NSPrintInfo object is also selected
for the operation. The NSPrintOperation creates a copy of the NSPrintInfo.
<b>finalWritePrintInfo</b> actually writes to that copy.<p>

<b>Creating an NSPrintPanel </b><p>

<UL><LI> + (NSPrintPanel *)<b>printPanel</b>	Returns a default NSPrintPanel object.</LI></UL>
<b>Customizing the Panel </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>setAccessoryView:</b>(NSView *)<i>aView</i>	Adds an NSView to the
panel.
</LI><LI> -  (NSView *)<b>accessoryView</b>	Returns the accessory NSView.</LI></UL>
<b>Running the Panel </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (int)<b>runModal</b>	Displays the Print panel and begins its event loop. If
it is necessary to resize the panel in order to accommodate the list of
printers, this method posts the notification NSWindowDidResizeNotification with
the receiving object to the default notification center.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>pickedButton:</b>(id)<i>sender</i>	Stops the event loop.</LI></UL>
<b>Updating the Panel's Display </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>pickedAllPages:</b>(id)<i>sender</i>	Updates the panel when the user
chooses all pages.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>pickedLayoutList:</b>(id)<i>sender</i>	Updates the panel when the
user chooses a new layout.</LI></UL>
<b>Communicating with the NSPrintInfo Object </b><p>

<UL><LI> - (void)<b>updateFromPrintInfo</b>	Reads NSPrintPanel's values from the
NSPrintInfo object.
</LI><LI> -  (void)<b>finalWritePrintInfo</b>	Writes NSPrintPanel's values to the
NSPrintInfo object.

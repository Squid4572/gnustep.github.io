<i>Introduction</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>This document describes the application programming interface (API) of
OpenStep<sup>(TM) </sup>. OpenStep is an operating system independent,
object-oriented application layer, based on NeXT's advanced object technology.
OpenStep contains these major components:<p>

<b>Figure 1</b>. Major Components of OpenStep<p>
<p>
<b>Application Kit</b>	The Application Kit<sup>(TM) </sup>provides the basic
software for writing interactive applicationsapplications that use
windows, draw on the screen, and respond to user actions on the keyboard and
mouse. The Application Kit contains the components that define the OpenStep
user interface.<p>
<p>
<b>Foundation Kit</b>	The Foundation Kit<sup>(TM) </sup>provides the
fundamental building blocks that applications use to manage data and resources.
It defines facilities for handling multibyte character sets, object persistency
and distribution, and provides an interface to common operating system
facilities. <p>
<p>
<b>Display PostScript System</b>	The Display PostScript<sup>(R) </sup>system
provides OpenStep with its device-independent imaging model.<p>
<p>
The OpenStep API is expressed in the Objective C language, an object-oriented
extension of ANSI C. The language itself lies outside of the scope of this
specification. For information on Objective C, see <i>NEXTSTEP Object-Oriented
Programming and the Objective C Language</i> (Addison-Wesley Publishing Co.,
1993). Please note that many of the types used for method argument and return
values in the OpenStep specification are defined in the Objective C language.
These include:<p>
<p>
BOOL<p>
Class<p>
id<p>
IMP<p>
nil<p>
Protocol<p>
SEL<p>
<p>
<p>
In addition, the type codes used to encode method argument and return types for
archiving and other purposes are also defined in the Objective C language.<p>
<p>

<b>How this Document Is Organized</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>The three components of OpenStep are described in separate chapters of
this document, starting with Chapter 1, The Application
Kit. Each chapter is organized in the same way, having these
standard sections:<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Classes</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>This section lists the API for each class defined in the component. For
each class, these subsections may appear:<p>
<p>
<b>Inherits From:</b>	The inheritance hierarchy for the class. For example:<p>
<p>
	NSPanel : NSWindow : NSResponder : NSObject<p>
<p>
	The first class listed (NSPanel, in this example) is the class's superclass.
The last class listed is generally NSObject, the root of almost all OpenStep
inheritance hierarchies. The classes between show the chain of inheritance from
NSObject to the superclass. (This particular example shows the inheritance
hierarchy for the NSMenu class of the Application Kit.)<p>
<p>
<b>Conforms To:</b>	The formal protocols that the class conforms to. These
include both protocols the class adopts and those it inherits from other
adopting classes. If inherited, the name of the adopting class in given in
parentheses. For example:<p>
<p>
	NSCoding<p>
NSCopying<p>
NSMutableCopying<p>
NSObject (NSObject)<p>
<p>
	(This particular example is from the NSArray class in the Foundation Kit.)<p>
<p>
<b>Declared In:</b>	The header file that declares the class interface. For
example:<p>
<p>
	Foundation/NSString.h<p>
<p>
	(This example is from the NSString class.) <p>
<p>
Next, the methods the class declares and implements are listed by name and
grouped by type. For example, methods used to draw are listed separately from
methods used to handle events. This listing includes all the methods declared
in the class. It also may include a method declared in a protocol the class
conforms to, if there is something extraordinary about the class's
implementation of the method. Each method is accompanied by a brief description
which states what the method does and mentions the arguments and return value,
if any.<p>
<p>
If a class lets you define another objecta delegatethat can
intercede on behalf of instances of the class, the methods that the delegate
can implement are described in a separate section. These are not methods
defined in the class; rather, they're methods that you can define to respond to
messages sent from instances of the class. In essence, this section documents
an informal protocol. But because these methods are so closely tied to the
behavior of a particular class, they're documented with the class rather than
in the Protocols section. <p>
<p>
Some class specifications have separate sections with titles such as
Methods Implemented by the Superview,
Methods Implemented by Observers, or
Methods Implemented by the Owner. These are also
informal protocols. They document methods that can or must be implemented to
receive messages on behalf of instances of the class.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Protocols</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>The protocols section documents both formal and informal protocols.
Formal protocols are those that are declared using the <b>@protocol</b>
compiler directive. They can be formally adopted and implemented by a class and
tested by sending an object a <b>conformsToProtocol:</b> message.<p>
<p>
Some formal protocols are adopted and implemented by OpenStep classes. However,
many formal protocols are declared by a kit, but not implemented by it. They
list methods that you can implement to respond to kit-generated messages.<p>
<p>
A few formal protocols are implemented by a kit, but not by a class that's part
of the documented API. Rather, the protocol is implemented by an anonymous
object that the kit supplies. The protocol lets you know what messages you can
send to the object.<p>
<p>
Like formal protocols, informal protocols declare a list of methods that others
are invited to implement. If an informal protocol is closely associated with
one particular classfor example, the list of methods implemented by the
delegateit's documented in the class description. Informal protocols
associated with more than one class, or not associated with any particular
class, are documented with the formal protocols in this section.<p>
<p>
Protocol information is organized into many of the same sections as described
above for a class specification. But protocols are not classes and therefore
differ somewhat in the kind of information provided. The sections of a protocol
specification are shown in bold in the following:<p>
<p>
<b>Adopted By:</b>	A list of the OpenStep classes that adopt the protocol. Many
protocols declare methods that applications must implement and so are not
adopted by any OpenStep classes.<p>
<p>
	Some protocols are implemented by anonymous objects (instances of an unknown
class); the protocol is the only information available about what messages the
object can respond to. Protocols that have an implementation available through
an anonymous object generally don't have to be reimplemented by other
classes.<p>
<p>
An informal protocol can't be formally adopted by a class and it can't formally
incorporate another protocol. So its description begins with information about
the category where it's declared:<p>
<p>
<b>Category Of:</b>	The class that the category belongs to. Informal protocols
are typically declared as categories of the NSObject class. This gives them the
widest possible scope.<p>
<p>
All descriptions of protocols, whether formal or informal, list where the
protocol is declared:<p>
<p>
<b>Declared In:</b>	The header file where the protocol is declared.<p>
<p>
If the protocol includes enough methods to warrant it, they're divided by type
and presented just as the methods of a class are.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Functions</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Related functions are grouped together under a heading that describes
the common purpose. Each function, its arguments, and its return value are
briefly described in an accompanying comment. <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Types and Constants</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Related defined types, enumeration constants, symbolic constants,
structures, and global variables are grouped together under a heading that
describes the common purpose. A short description accompanies each group.<p>

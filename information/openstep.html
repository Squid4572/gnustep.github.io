<h1>The OpenStep Story</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.next.com/">NeXT Computer Inc,</a> and
<a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems Inc.</a> teamed up
in late 1993 to push a free object layer API based on the NeXTSTEP
object system. This agreement evolved into the OpenStep
specification which was published by NeXT in a first draft back in
summer 1994.</p>
<h2>GNUstep Hype and History</h2>
<p>Early on many developers (educational and business) realized
that the NeXTSTEP environment provided a great tool and reduced the
amount of time necessary for writing applications. Still the
portability issue was hard to solve since these application were
tied to machines running NeXTSTEP.</p>
<p>It was the team around Paul Kunz at SLAC who decided to port
their application differently than others did. Instead of rewriting
HippoDraw from scratch on the new system and only "reusing" the
overall app design and ideas, they rewrote the objects their
application depended upon...the NeXTSTEP object layer.</p>
<p>As a result they created the first version of libobjcX which
enabled them to port HippoDraw to UNIX systems running X-Window
without changing a single line of their applications source.</p>
<p>After the OpenStep initiative became public, The next logical
step was to make a new "objcX" which would adhere to the new
APIs.</p>
<h2>GNUstep Implementation</h2>
<p>The first thing that needed to be done was implement the
FoundationKit as specified in OpenStep. The libobjects library was
around even before the GNUstep idea was born, but it needed to be
extended and repackaged to fulfill the FoundationKit's job. This
has resulted in libobjects being renamed to the GNUstep Base
Library; its new name signifies its important role as the
underlying support for all of GNUstep.</p>
<p>The ApplicationKit is closely tied to the Display Postscript
System because all of the graphics drawing is to be implemented in
the Postscript language. The GNUstep developers realized
implementing a Display Postscript System would be an incredible
task so they decided take an approach which would allow the
ApplicationKit to be implemented without necessarily having the
Display Postscript System implemented.</p>
<p>The design involved splitting up the ApplicationKit
implementation into two parts; a front-end and a back-end. The
front-end would be independent of the graphics display system, so
it would only implement behavior without performing any display
operations. The back-end would be specific to a graphics display
system and it would only need to perform the display operations for
that graphics display system. The front-end is called the GNUstep
GUI Library. The backend is called, simply, the GNUstep
Backend.</p>

<h2>Beyond OpenStep</h2>
<p>While implementing a free software version of the OpenStep
specification is a great idea; GNUstep is growing beyond this
initial task to become a powerful development environment and a
sophisticated user environment.</p>
<p>The GNUstep Database Library and The GNUstep 3D Kit are examples
of two auxiliary projects that take OpenStep as the base API for
extending into other areas; the former into database programming
and the latter into 3D graphics.</p>
<h3>More and more</h3>
<p>A number of people and institutions are helping in this
project.</p>
<p>But there are even more efforts which might be of interest to
everybody who likes the GNUstep idea. A bunch of them is listed on
our <a href="../resources/resources.html">Resources page</a>.</p>
<h2>OpenStep compliance</h2>
<p>The motivation behind GNUstep <i>is</i> to make porting our
applications easier, to leverage the benefits of the Objective-C
language, and to push the idea of OpenStep as a common object
oriented API; especially on systems which are not covered by
commercial implementations of this standard.</p>
<h2>Our Time frame</h2>
<p>Most GNU projects have no real time frame since all development
is done for free. The current team is very interested in pushing
the project ahead but "time" and "space" will remain limited. So if
things are moving too slow for you... join and help us!</p>

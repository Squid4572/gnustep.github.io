<h1>A GNUstep Testimonial</h1>
<blockquote>"Four months ago I knew nothing about Objective C and
GNUstep. One day I cam across the announcement of a new GNUstep
release and decided to go deeper into it.<br />
<br />
<p>The first thing that struck me as I was learning is that GNUstep
as well as the Cocoa Framework from Apple are almost *exactly*
identical to the NeXTstep APIs that was defined something like 10
years ago! And a decade is an eternity in the software industry. So
I said to myself that if a Framework (and its programming language
- Objective C) came through these 10 years untouched there must be
something special about it. (As a matter of fact I completely
overlooked the NeXTstep/OpenStep/Rhapsody saga in the 1990's."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four months later here is what I have discovered</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First of all, when you look at it, it is obvious that all the
layers of the Framework (the Display engine, Foundation Library and
Application Kit) were all (cleverly) designed a)from scratch and
b)all at once and they fit perfectly one with another. The entire
edifice is extremelly consistent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Framework is written in Objective C (still is on Mac OS X).
It is a simple yet powerful OO language. It is much simpler than
C++ and even though it is a compiled language it shares many of the
features found in modern semi-compiled and interpreted OO language
like Java, Ruby or Python. Just to give you an example Objective C
has some remarkable introspection capabilities which makes it easy
to bridge with Java or Ruby (as I did in RIGS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although I'm not familiar with this aspect, I suspect that the
development tools coming with the Framework (Interface Builder and
Project Builder) are very powerful tools and I'm not sure that any
other tool on the market has reached this level of integration,
ease of use and power since then. Gorm and ProjectCenter are
GNUstep equivalent (work in progress).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared with GNOME, KDE, or MFC, the NextStep/GNUStep/Cocoa
Framework is much, much simpler. I have been a GNU/Linux user for a
decade (since the beginning actually) and I could never convince
myself to invest enough time to master GNOME or KDE. Yet the
NextStep/GNUStep/Cocoa Framework offers all the libraries and
modern programming technics that a programmer would expect
(included distributed objects!). The learning curve is also very
smooth. Reading the 3 following documents is enough to understand
and master 90% of the Framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Object-Oriented Programming and the Objective-C language (a must
read!) <a href=
"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html">
ObjectiveC</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foundation Library - Objective C API <a href=
"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/ObjC_classic/_index.html">
Foundation Reference</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application Kit - Objective C API <a href=
"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/ObjC_classic/_index.html">
AppKit Reference</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All the Framework specifications are public and well documented
(see above)</li>
</ol>
<p>Bottom line: the NextStep/GNUStep/Cocoa Framework is about
consistency, simplicity and a power.</p>
